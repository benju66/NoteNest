# üîç Investigation - App Not Closing Properly

**Critical Issue:** App may not be fully closing when main window is closed  
**Impact:** Old code continues running, rebuild doesn't take effect

---

## üö® **HYPOTHESIS: Background Services**

### **IHostedService Pattern:**

The app uses Generic Host with IHostedService for background tasks:
- `TodoSyncService` - Monitors note saves
- `DatabaseMetadataUpdateService` - Syncs database
- `SearchIndexSyncService` - Updates search index
- `DatabaseFileWatcherService` - Watches files

**These services run in background and may keep the app alive!**

## üîç **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### **Check if processes are still running:**
```powershell
Get-Process -Name "NoteNest*" | Select-Object ProcessName, Id, StartTime
```

**If you see processes:**
- ‚ùå App didn't close properly
- ‚ùå Old code still running
- ‚ùå Rebuild doesn't take effect

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Force kill all NoteNest processes
Get-Process -Name "NoteNest*" | Stop-Process -Force

# Verify they're gone
Get-Process -Name "NoteNest*"
# Should show: "Cannot find a process with the name"

# NOW rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet build

# Run fresh
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
```

## üéØ **PROPER SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE**

**If app isn't closing properly, try:**
1. Close main window
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Check Task Manager ‚Üí Details tab
4. Look for "NoteNest.UI.exe"
5. If still there ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí End Task
6. THEN rebuild

**Please check Task Manager and let me know if processes are lingering!**
