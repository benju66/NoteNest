# 🧪 Quick Test: Category Breadcrumb Display

**CLOSE THE APP FIRST!** The running app has old code.

---

## 🚀 TEST STEPS (5 minutes)

### **Prep:**
```bash
# Close NoteNest completely
# Then rebuild:
dotnet clean NoteNest.sln
dotnet build NoteNest.sln --configuration Debug
.\Launch-With-Console.bat
```

---

### **Test 1: Nested Folder (2 min)**
```
1. Find a nested folder in your tree (e.g., "Personal/Budget" or any subfolder)
2. Right-click it → "Add to Todo Categories"
3. Press Ctrl+B to open Todo panel
4. Look under "CATEGORIES" section

✅ EXPECTED: Shows "📁 Personal > Budget" (breadcrumb with context!)
❌ OLD BEHAVIOR: Would not appear (hidden by hierarchy filter)
```

---

### **Test 2: Root Folder (1 min)**
```
1. Right-click a root folder (e.g., "Personal" at top level)
2. "Add to Todo Categories"
3. Check Todo panel

✅ EXPECTED: Shows "📁 Personal" (simple name, no breadcrumb)
```

---

### **Test 3: Click to Filter (1 min)**
```
1. Click on a category in the CATEGORIES section
2. Todo list should filter to show only todos in that category

✅ EXPECTED: Filtering works
```

---

### **Test 4: RTF Auto-Add (1 min)**
```
1. Create note in a nested folder (e.g., "Work/Projects/Alpha")
2. Type: "[test breadcrumb]"
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. Check CATEGORIES section

✅ EXPECTED: Shows "📁 Work > Projects > Alpha" (auto-added with breadcrumb!)
```

---

## 📋 CONSOLE LOGS TO LOOK FOR

**Manual Add:**
```
[CategoryOps] Adding category to todos: Budget
✅ Category added to todos: Budget
[CategoryStore] Added category: Budget
[CategoryTree] CategoryStore changed, refreshing tree
```

**RTF Auto-Add:**
```
[TodoSync] Note is in category: <guid> - todos will be auto-categorized
[TodoSync] ✅ Auto-added category to todo panel: Work > Projects > Alpha (for RTF todos)
[CategoryTree] CategoryStore changed, refreshing tree
```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS = BREADCRUMBS VISIBLE

**You should see:**
- 📁 Personal > Budget
- 📁 Work > Projects > Alpha
- 📁 Work > Projects > Beta

**NOT just:**
- Budget
- Alpha
- Beta

---

## 🎯 IF IT WORKS

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ Use it! Categories now have rich context
2. ✅ Test with multiple nested folders
3. ✅ Enjoy the clean UX
4. 🤔 Decide later if you want full hierarchy (Option 3)

**Migration to Option 3 is easy whenever you're ready!**
