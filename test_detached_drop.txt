TEST PROCEDURE: Detached Window to Main Window Drop
==================================================

This test will help diagnose why dragging tabs from detached windows back to the main window fails.

SETUP:
1. Build and run NoteNest
2. Open Debug Output window in Visual Studio OR use DebugView++ to capture debug output
3. Filter for "[DIAGNOSTIC]" messages

TEST STEPS:
1. Launch NoteNest
2. Open 2-3 tabs in the main window
3. Right-click on a tab and select "Detach Tab" (or drag a tab outside the window beyond 75 pixels)
4. Confirm a detached window appears with the tab
5. Now drag a tab FROM the detached window BACK to the main window
6. Try dropping it:
   - Over an existing tab in the main window
   - In the empty space after tabs
   - Between two tabs

EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:
Look for these key diagnostic messages:

[DIAGNOSTIC] FindPaneViewAtPoint called from DetachedWindow, SourcePaneView: [HashCode1]
[DIAGNOSTIC] Hit test at window point (...) returned: [ElementType or null]
[DIAGNOSTIC] Mouse captured by: [TabControl or nothing]
[DIAGNOSTIC] Returning source PaneView: [HashCode1]  <-- THIS IS THE PROBLEM IF IT MATCHES SOURCE
[DIAGNOSTIC] DetermineDragTarget - SourceWindow: DetachedWindow, CurrentPaneView: [HashCode1]
[DIAGNOSTIC] Target PaneView found: [HashCode], Are they same: True  <-- THIS CONFIRMS THE BUG
[DIAGNOSTIC] HandleMainWindowPaneDropSync - Source PaneView: [HashCode1], Target PaneView: [HashCode1]
[DIAGNOSTIC] Are ViewModels equal: True  <-- THIS TRIGGERS SAME-PANE LOGIC INSTEAD OF CROSS-WINDOW

KEY INDICATORS OF THE BUG:
1. FindPaneViewAtPoint returns the same HashCode as the source PaneView
2. "Are they same: True" in DetermineDragTarget
3. "Are ViewModels equal: True" in HandleMainWindowPaneDropSync
4. The tab stays in the detached window instead of moving to main

WHAT TO REPORT:
Please copy all [DIAGNOSTIC] messages from the debug output and note:
- Which fallback path was taken in FindPaneViewAtPoint
- Whether hit testing returned null
- Whether the source and target PaneViews have the same HashCode
- Whether the tab moved or stayed in place
