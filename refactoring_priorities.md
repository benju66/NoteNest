# Refactoring Priorities

## Priority 1: Blocking Issues (Must fix this week)
- [ ] NoteService.cs (1000+ lines) - Blocks plugin integration
- [ ] SmartTextEditor.cs (800+ lines) - Blocks markdown improvements
- [ ] No error notification system - Blocks all user feedback

## Priority 2: High Impact (Fix next)
- [ ] MainViewModel.cs (600+ lines) - Makes debugging hard
- [ ] SearchIndexService.cs - Performance bottleneck

## Priority 3: Nice to Have (Fix as touched)
- [ ] Static dependencies (AppLogger.Instance)
- [ ] Long methods in utilities
