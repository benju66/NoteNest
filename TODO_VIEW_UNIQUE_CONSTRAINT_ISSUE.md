## üö® **NEW ISSUE FOUND**

### **Error:**
```
[WRN] Projection sync failed after CreateTodoCommand: 
SQLite Error 19: 'UNIQUE constraint failed: todo_view.id'
```

### **What This Means:**

TodoProjection is trying to INSERT a todo into `todo_view` table, but a row with that ID already exists!

**Possible Causes:**
1. Stale data in todo_view from previous tests
2. Todo was created multiple times (retries?)
3. Projection processed same event twice
4. todo_view not cleared when events.db was cleared

---

## üîç **INVESTIGATION NEEDED**

### **Questions:**

1. Does todo_view have stale entries?
2. Are todos being created in todos table?
3. Is the issue with projection INSERT or is data actually there?
4. Is TodoStore receiving the event?
