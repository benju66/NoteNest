## ðŸ“Š WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **In the Application:**
- Does todo appear in panel within 1-2 seconds?
- Do tags appear shortly after (if applicable)?
- Can you complete/delete the todo?

### **In the Logs** (I'll check these):
```
[TodoStore] âœ… Created TodoItem from event data (optimistic)
[TodoStore] âœ… Todo added to UI collection (optimistic)
[TodoStore] ðŸ”„ Projections synchronized - Reloading...
[TodoStore] âœ… UI collection updated
```

**The feature is fixed if:**
1. âœ… Todo appears within 1-2 seconds (no restart)
2. âœ… Todo shows in correct category (or Uncategorized)
3. âœ… Tags appear (if folder/note has tags)
4. âœ… Can complete/delete todo immediately

**Please test now and let me know what happens!**

I can check the logs afterward to verify everything worked correctly.
