# üîç Checkbox Completion & RTF Reconciliation

## Your Two Questions:

### **1. Why can't I click the checkbox to complete a task?**

Looking at the logs, **checkbox completion IS working:**

```
[CompleteTodoHandler] ‚úÖ Todo completion toggled
[TodoCompletedEvent] Published
[TodoStore] Updated todo in UI collection
```

**If the checkbox isn't responding, check:**
- Is there a UI error in the console?
- Does the checkbox appear clickable (not grayed out)?
- Is there a delay before it responds?

**The command execution IS working based on logs!**

---

### **2. Does RTF parser create a new task when one is completed?**

**Current behavior (from code review):**

The parser just looks for `[anything in brackets]`.

**What this means:**

**Scenario A: You manually check a box in RTF:**
```
Before: [task to do]
After:  [x] [task to do]  ‚Üê Checkbox added in RTF
```

**Parser will find:**
- `[x]` ‚Üí Filtered out (exact exclusion, line 143)
- `[task to do]` ‚Üí Matches existing todo ‚Üí Updates timestamp

**Result:** ‚úÖ No duplicate created

---

**Scenario B: You delete the brackets:**
```
Before: [task to do]
After:  task to do  ‚Üê Brackets removed
```

**Parser will find:**
- Nothing in brackets

**Reconciliation:**
- Existing todo not found in note
- Marks as "orphaned"

**Result:** ‚úÖ Todo marked orphaned (not deleted)

---

**Scenario C: You mark complete in app, note still has brackets:**
```
RTF note: [task to do]
App: Task marked complete ‚úÖ
```

**Next time note saves:**
- Parser finds `[task to do]`
- Matches existing todo by stable ID
- Sees it's already completed
- Leaves it alone

**Result:** ‚úÖ Stays completed

---

## üéØ **The Reconciliation Logic**

Looking at `ReconcileTodosAsync()` (lines 310-400):

```
1. Get existing todos for this note
2. For each candidate from RTF:
   - Match by stable ID (line + text hash)
   - If found: Update timestamp (mark as "seen")
   - If not found: Create new
3. For existing todos not found in RTF:
   - Mark as orphaned
```

**Key: Matching is by content+line, NOT by completion state**

So:
- ‚úÖ Completing in app doesn't affect RTF
- ‚úÖ Having `[task]` in RTF doesn't un-complete it
- ‚úÖ They stay in sync

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issue: Checkbox Not Responding**

**If checkbox truly isn't working, possible causes:**

1. **UI Thread Deadlock**
   - Command is async but UI frozen
   - Check for exceptions in logs

2. **Command Not Bound**
   - Checkbox `IsChecked` binding broken
   - Check XAML binding errors

3. **Visual Feedback Delay**
   - Command executes but UI doesn't update
   - Check if TodoStore is receiving events

---

## üß™ **Test Checkbox Completion**

1. **Click checkbox** on a todo
2. **Check logs immediately:**
   ```powershell
   $log = Get-Content "C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\Logs\notenest-20251020.log" -Tail 50
   $log | Select-String -Pattern "ToggleCompletion|CompleteTodo|IsCompleted"
   ```

**Expected:**
```
[TodoItemViewModel] ToggleCompletionAsync called
[CompleteTodoHandler] Creating completion toggle
[TodoCompletedEvent] Published
[TodoStore] Updated todo: completed = true
```

**If NO logs appear:**
- Command not being triggered
- UI binding issue
- Check for XAML errors

**If logs appear but checkbox doesn't change:**
- Event processed
- UI not updating
- Check TodoStore event handler

---

**Can you try clicking a checkbox and then send me the last 50 log lines?**

This will show if it's a command issue or a UI update issue.
