# ‚ö° QUICK FIX - Delete and Rebuild Databases

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Old todo events causing deserialization errors  
**Solution:** Delete databases, let app rebuild them  
**Time:** 1 minute  
**Risk:** ZERO (no real users, test data only)

---

## üéØ **THE QUICKEST FIX**

Since you have **no current users** and this is test data, the fastest solution is:

### **Delete These 2 Databases:**

1. `C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\events.db`
2. `C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\projections.db`

**The app will automatically recreate them on next startup!**

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Close NoteNest** (if running)

### **Step 2: Delete Databases**

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
$dbPath = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NoteNest"
Remove-Item "$dbPath\events.db" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$dbPath\events.db-shm" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$dbPath\events.db-wal" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$dbPath\projections.db" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$dbPath\projections.db-shm" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$dbPath\projections.db-wal" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Write-Host "‚úÖ Deleted events.db and projections.db" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "üìù App will recreate them on next startup" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

### **Step 3: Start NoteNest**

The app will:
- ‚úÖ Create fresh events.db
- ‚úÖ Create fresh projections.db  
- ‚úÖ Run migrations
- ‚úÖ Ready for new events!

### **Step 4: Test Note-Linked Tasks**

1. Create or open a note
2. Type: "Meeting agenda [call John about deadline]"
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. **Expected:** Todo appears in TodoPlugin panel! üéâ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **WHAT YOU'LL LOSE**

**Will be deleted:**
- ‚ùå Old test todos (from yesterday's testing)
- ‚ùå Old category creation events
- ‚ùå Old note creation events

**Will be kept:**
- ‚úÖ RTF note files (source of truth!)
- ‚úÖ tree.db (legacy, still referenced)
- ‚úÖ user_preferences (category selections)
- ‚úÖ All note content
- ‚úÖ All folder structure

**Impact:**
- Notes will still show in tree (RTF files exist)
- But no "created date" event history
- Categories will still exist (from RTF file discovery)

---

## üéØ **WHY THIS WORKS**

### **Event Sourcing Hierarchy:**

```
RTF Files (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
  ‚Üì
  FileWatcher detects files
  ‚Üì
  Fires events (NoteCreated, CategoryCreated)
  ‚Üì
  Events saved to events.db
  ‚Üì
  Projections build tree_view, entity_tags
  ‚Üì
  UI displays data
```

**Deleting events.db:**
- ‚úÖ RTF files unchanged (source of truth preserved)
- ‚úÖ FileWatcher will rediscover files on startup
- ‚úÖ New events created automatically
- ‚úÖ Projections rebuild
- ‚úÖ Everything appears in UI

---

## üöÄ **EXPECTED RESULT**

After deleting databases and restarting:

**App Startup:**
```
[INF] Initializing event store...
[INF] Creating events.db schema
[INF] Initializing projections...
[INF] Creating projections.db schema
[INF] FileWatcher: Scanning notes directory...
[INF] FileWatcher: Found 15 notes
[DBG] Discovered 54 event types (includes Todo events!)
[INF] Application started
```

**When You Save Note with [bracket]:**
```
[INF] [TodoSync] Processing note: Meeting.rtf
[DBG] [TodoSync] Found 1 todo candidates
[INF] [CreateTodoHandler] Creating todo: 'call John'
[INF] [CreateTodoHandler] ‚úÖ Todo persisted to event store
[INF] Saved 1 events for aggregate TodoAggregate
[DBG] [TodoStore] üì¨ Received domain event: TodoCreatedEvent
[INF] [TodoStore] Created todo in UI: call John
```

**Todo appears in panel!** ‚úÖ

2. `RTF_PARSER_NOTE_LINKED_TASK_ANALYSIS.md` - Architecture deep-dive  
3. `NOTE_LINKED_TASK_FIX_CONFIDENCE_BOOST.md` - Pre-implementation analysis
4. `NOTE_LINKED_TASK_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Code changes
5. `EVENT_DESERIALIZATION_ISSUE_INVESTIGATION.md` - Deserialization problem
6. `CLEAR_OLD_TODO_EVENTS.ps1` - Cleanup script
7. `NOTE_LINKED_TASK_FINAL_FIX.md` - This document

## ‚úÖ **READY TO EXECUTE**

**Run this command:**

```powershell
$dbPath = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NoteNest"
Remove-Item "$dbPath\events.db" -Force
Remove-Item "$dbPath\projections.db" -Force
Write-Host "‚úÖ Databases deleted - restart app to rebuild!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**Then test note-linked tasks!**
