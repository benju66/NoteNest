**Major Challenge:** Non-destructive RTF editing

**Total Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (This is what users will love!)

## 🎯 Critical Path Analysis

### **To Get a "Complete" Todo Plugin:**

**MUST HAVE** (Cannot ship without):
1. ✅ Persistence (DONE)
2. ⏳ RTF Integration (3-4 weeks) **← THE KILLER FEATURE**
3. ⏳ Search Integration (1 week)

**SHOULD HAVE** (High value):
4. ⏳ Tag management UI (3-4 days)
5. ⏳ Due date picker (3-4 days)
6. ⏳ Description editor (1 week)

**NICE TO HAVE** (Polish):
7. ⏳ Recurrence (1 week)
8. ⏳ Subtasks (1 week)
9. ⏳ Drag-and-drop (3-4 days)

**Minimum Viable Product:** Items 1-3 = **5-6 weeks total**  
**Full Feature Set:** Items 1-9 = **10-12 weeks total**

## 🎨 What Makes This Unique

Your implementation guide emphasizes **RTF integration** as the differentiator:

> "A comprehensive task management plugin that seamlessly integrates with NoteNest's RTF-based note system, providing unified task tracking with bidirectional synchronization between notes and todos."

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Todo panel works
- ✅ SQLite persistence works
- ❌ **RTF integration not started** ← This is what makes it special!

**Without RTF integration**, you have a nice todo app.  
**With RTF integration**, you have a **revolutionary unified notes+tasks system**.

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### **Option 1: MVP First (Recommended)**
1. ✅ Persistence (DONE)
2. Test & stabilize current features (1-2 days)
3. **RTF Integration** (3-4 weeks) ⭐ Focus here!
4. Search integration (1 week)
5. Ship MVP, gather feedback
6. Add polish features based on usage

**Timeline:** 6-7 weeks to MVP  
**Risk:** Medium (RTF sync is complex)  
**Value:** Very High (unique feature)

### **Option 2: Polish First**
1. ✅ Persistence (DONE)
2. Tag management UI (3-4 days)
3. Due date picker (3-4 days)
4. Description editor (1 week)
5. Test & polish (3-4 days)
6. **Then RTF integration**

**Timeline:** 3 weeks to polished current features  
**Risk:** Low  
**Value:** Medium (nice todo app, not unique)

### **Option 3: Parallel Development**
1. ✅ Persistence (DONE)
2. Start RTF infrastructure (IRtfService)
3. While that's building, add tag UI & due date picker
4. Continue RTF integration
5. Ship when RTF works

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  
**Risk:** Medium-High (context switching)  
**Value:** High

## 🏆 Summary

### **What's Done:**
- ✅ 40% of implementation guide
- ✅ All foundation work
- ✅ Production-grade database
- ✅ Working UI
- ✅ Smart lists

### **What's Remaining:**
- ⏳ 60% of implementation guide
- ⏳ **RTF Integration** (the signature feature)
- ⏳ Search integration
- ⏳ Advanced UI features
- ⏳ Testing & polish

### **Biggest Gap:**
**RTF bidirectional sync** - This is what's in the guide's title and executive summary. Without it, you have a todo app. With it, you have the vision from the guide.

### **Recommendation:**
**Focus on RTF Integration next.** It's the hardest part, but it's what will make users go "wow, this is amazing!" Everything else is just nice-to-have polish.

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Test persistence** - Make sure todos survive app restarts
2. **Review RTF integration requirements** - Read Phase 5 of your guide
3. **Decide on approach** - MVP with RTF, or polish first?
4. **Start next phase** - Either IRtfService or UI enhancements

The choice is yours, but the foundation is solid! 🚀
