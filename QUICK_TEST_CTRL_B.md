# 🧪 Quick Test: Does Ctrl+B Work?

## Test This First:

1. **Launch the app** (already running is fine)
2. **Press Ctrl+B** (with the app window focused)
3. **Watch what happens**

---

## Expected Results:

### **If Ctrl+B Works:**
✅ A 300px panel should slide in from the right
✅ You should see a header "Todo Manager" (or it might be empty if ActivePluginTitle isn't set)
✅ The panel should have a smooth animation

**This means:**
- ✅ The command is wired up correctly
- ✅ The animation works
- ❌ The activity bar button click has a binding issue

### **If Ctrl+B Does Nothing:**
❌ No panel appears
❌ Nothing changes

**This means:**
- ❌ The command itself isn't working
- ❌ Either ViewModel isn't initialized or IServiceProvider is null
- Need to check the diagnostic logs

---

## 🎯 Try It Now:

**Just press Ctrl+B while the app is focused and tell me what happens!**

This will narrow down whether it's:
- **Button binding issue** (Ctrl+B works, button doesn't)
- **Command/ViewModel issue** (neither works)
