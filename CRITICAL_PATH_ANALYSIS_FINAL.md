## üéØ THE SMOKING GUN (From Logs Line 11628-11629)

```
11628: [TodoSync] Note not in tree DB yet: Project Test 2.rtf - FileWatcher will add it soon
11629: [TodoSync] Creating 1 uncategorized todos (will auto-categorize on next save)
```

**THIS IS THE PROBLEM!**

---

## üö® WHY TODOS APPEAR IN "UNCATEGORIZED"

### **The Critical Path (What ACTUALLY Happens):**

```
1. User types [todo] in note "Project Test 2.rtf"
2. User presses Ctrl+S
   ‚Üì
3. SaveManager fires NoteSaved event
   ‚Üì
4. TodoSyncService.OnNoteSaved() receives event
   ‚Üì
5. TodoSyncService queries tree.db for note
   ‚Üì
6. ‚ùå Note NOT found in tree.db! (Line 11628)
   ‚Üì
7. TodoSyncService creates todo with CategoryId = NULL (Line 11629)
   ‚Üì
8. Todo created in "Uncategorized"
   ‚Üì
9. Later: FileWatcher adds note to tree.db
   ‚Üì
10. Too late - todo already created without category!
```

---

## üîç THE ROOT CAUSE

**TodoSyncService depends on note being in tree.db to determine category.**

**But:**
- NoteSaved event fires IMMEDIATELY when user presses Ctrl+S
- tree.db update happens LATER (via DatabaseMetadataUpdateService or FileWatcher)
- Race condition: TodoSyncService runs BEFORE tree.db is updated
- Result: Can't find note ‚Üí Can't determine category ‚Üí Creates uncategorized todo

---

## üìä WHY IT ONLY WORKS AFTER RESTART

**On Restart:**
1. tree.db is fully populated ‚úÖ
2. All notes have entries ‚úÖ
3. TodoSyncService can find notes ‚úÖ
4. Can determine category from note.ParentId ‚úÖ
5. Todos load with correct CategoryId ‚úÖ

**On First Save:**
1. tree.db might not have note yet ‚ùå
2. TodoSyncService can't find note ‚ùå
3. Defaults to uncategorized ‚ùå

---

## üí° WHY ALL OUR FIXES DIDN'T WORK

**We were fixing the WRONG problem!**

We thought:
- Event bus timing issue
- Projection sync timing
- Database query timing

**But the REAL issue:**
- TodoSyncService runs before tree.db is updated
- Can't determine CategoryId
- Creates todo with CategoryId = NULL
- Appears in "Uncategorized"

**ALL our fixes were for events AFTER todo creation.**

**The bug is BEFORE todo creation - in category determination!**

---

## ‚úÖ THE ACTUAL SOLUTION NEEDED

### **Option A: Ensure tree.db Updated Before TodoSync** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Make TodoSyncService wait for tree.db to be updated:**

```csharp
private async void OnNoteSaved(object sender, NoteSavedEventArgs e)
{
    // Wait a bit for DatabaseMetadataUpdateService to update tree.db
    await Task.Delay(200);  // or wait for event
    
    // NOW query tree.db - should have the note
    var noteNode = await _treeRepository.GetNodeByPathAsync(filePath);
    
    // Should find it now!
}
```

---

### **Option B: Get CategoryId from NoteSavedEventArgs** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**If NoteSavedEventArgs contains category info, use it directly:**

```csharp
private async void OnNoteSaved(object sender, NoteSavedEventArgs e)
{
    // If event has category info, use it!
    var categoryId = e.CategoryId;  // If this exists
    
    // No need to query tree.db!
    await ReconcileTodosAsync(e.NoteId, e.FilePath, candidates, categoryId);
}
```

---

### **Option C: Make tree.db Update Synchronous** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Ensure DatabaseMetadataUpdateService completes BEFORE TodoSync:**

- Change event handler ordering
- Make tree.db update blocking
- TodoSync runs after tree.db is guaranteed ready

---

## üéØ WHICH SOLUTION?

**I need to investigate:**

1. **What's in NoteSavedEventArgs?** (Does it have CategoryId?)
2. **How is DatabaseMetadataUpdateService triggered?** (Same event?)
3. **Can we control event handler order?** (Which runs first?)
4. **Is there a tree.db updated event?** (Can TodoSync subscribe to that instead?)

---

## üö® CRITICAL REALIZATION

**We've been debugging the WRONG LAYER!**

**Layers:**
- ‚ùå Event bus (we fixed this - works fine)
- ‚ùå Projection sync (we fixed this - works fine)  
- ‚ùå Database query timing (we fixed this - works fine)
- ‚úÖ **CATEGORY DETERMINATION** ‚Üê This is the actual bug!

**The issue is:**
- TodoSyncService can't determine category
- Creates todo with NULL category
- Real-time updates work, but todos are uncategorized

**This explains BOTH symptoms:**
1. Todos don't appear until restart (they do, but in wrong category)
2. Todos appear in "Uncategorized" (because CategoryId = NULL)

---

## üìã NEXT INVESTIGATION STEPS

1. Check NoteSavedEventArgs structure (has CategoryId?)
2. Check DatabaseMetadataUpdateService timing
3. Check if tree.db update event exists
4. Find how to get CategoryId reliably at save time

**This is the REAL root cause - not event timing!**
