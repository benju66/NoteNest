# Category-Aware Quick Add - Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
The quick add function was not adding manually created todo items to the selected category. All new todos were being created in "uncategorized" regardless of which category was selected in the tree.

## Root Cause
The TreeView selection was not being propagated back to the ViewModel. While the TreeView was tracking which item was selected internally, the `CategoryTreeViewModel.SelectedCategory` property was never being updated, which meant:

1. The `CategorySelected` event was never raised
2. `TodoPanelViewModel.OnCategorySelected` was never called
3. `TodoList.SelectedCategoryId` remained null
4. New todos were created with `CategoryId = null` (uncategorized)

## Solution
Added a `SelectedItemChanged` event handler to wire up the TreeView selection to the ViewModel:

### XAML Change (TodoPanelView.xaml)
```xml
<TreeView ItemsSource="{Binding CategoryTree.Categories}"
          ...
          SelectedItemChanged="CategoryTreeView_SelectedItemChanged">
```

### Code-Behind Change (TodoPanelView.xaml.cs)
```csharp
private void CategoryTreeView_SelectedItemChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs<object> e)
{
    if (DataContext is TodoPanelViewModel panelVm)
    {
        // When a category is selected, update the ViewModel
        if (e.NewValue is CategoryNodeViewModel categoryNode)
        {
            panelVm.CategoryTree.SelectedCategory = categoryNode;
            _logger.Debug($"[TodoPanelView] Category selected: {categoryNode.Name} (ID: {categoryNode.CategoryId})");
        }
        // When a todo item is selected, we don't change the category selection
        // The category filter should remain active
    }
}
```

## Data Flow (Now Working)
1. User clicks a category in the TreeView
2. TreeView fires `SelectedItemChanged` event
3. `CategoryTreeView_SelectedItemChanged` handler catches it
4. If it's a `CategoryNodeViewModel`, set `CategoryTree.SelectedCategory`
5. This triggers the property setter in `CategoryTreeViewModel` (line 78-89)
6. The setter raises `CategorySelected?.Invoke(this, value.CategoryId)` (line 86)
7. `TodoPanelViewModel.OnCategorySelected` is subscribed to this event (line 28)
8. It sets `TodoList.SelectedCategoryId = categoryId` (line 49)
9. This updates the `_selectedCategoryId` field in `TodoListViewModel`
10. When quick add is executed, it uses `CategoryId = _selectedCategoryId` (line 180)
11. ✅ Todo is created in the correct category!

## Testing
To test:
1. Open the Todo Plugin
2. Select a category in the tree (e.g., "Work", "Personal")
3. Type a todo in the quick add textbox
4. Press Enter or click the plus icon
5. ✅ The todo should appear in the selected category
6. Restart the app
7. ✅ The todo should still be in that category (persistence verified)

## Files Modified
- `NoteNest.UI/Plugins/TodoPlugin/UI/Views/TodoPanelView.xaml` - Added `SelectedItemChanged` event
- `NoteNest.UI/Plugins/TodoPlugin/UI/Views/TodoPanelView.xaml.cs` - Added event handler

2. ✅ Plus icon added
3. ✅ Category-aware quick add working

Ready for next milestone: CQRS implementation or additional UX features.
