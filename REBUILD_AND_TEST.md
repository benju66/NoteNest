# 🔨 Rebuild and Test with New Diagnostics

## The logs show you're running the OLD build!

The plugin is registered (✅ lines 83-87 in your log), but when you pressed Ctrl+B, there are NO diagnostic logs that I added (no 🎯 messages).

This means you need to rebuild with the latest code.

---

## 🔧 Steps to Rebuild:

### **1. Close the app** (if still running)

### **2. Clean and rebuild:**
```powershell
dotnet clean
dotnet build NoteNest.sln
```

### **3. Launch the NEW build:**
```powershell
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
```

### **4. Press Ctrl+B**

### **5. Check the log file again**

This time you should see logs like:
```
🎯 ActivateTodoPlugin() called - User clicked activity bar button
🎯 TodoPlugin retrieved in Activate: True
📦 TodoPlugin.CreatePanel() called
🎨 TodoPanelView constructor called
📋 TodoListViewModel constructor called
```

## 📤 What to Look For:

After rebuilding and pressing Ctrl+B, check for:

1. **Does the app still crash?**
   - If yes: What's the LAST log message before it crashes?
   
2. **Do you see any 🎯 or 📦 or 🎨 or 📋 messages?**
   - These will tell us exactly where it's failing

3. **Do you see any ❌ error messages?**
   - These will show the exception details

---

## ⚡ Quick Command Sequence:

```powershell
# Close app if running
# Then run these:
dotnet clean
dotnet build NoteNest.sln
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
# Press Ctrl+B
# Share the new log file
```

The new build has much better error handling and won't just silently crash. If something fails, you'll see exactly what!
