# üîç Diagnostic Instructions - Find the Issue

## Diagnostic Code Added

I've added MessageBox popups that will tell us exactly what's happening (or not happening).

---

## Run the Diagnostic Version

```bash
dotnet run --project NoteNest.UI
```

---

## What You'll See

### **Step 1: Window Loads**
You should see a MessageBox popup:
```
Window loaded successfully!
RightPanelColumn exists: True/False
DataContext: True/False
```

**What this tells us:**
- If RightPanelColumn = **False** ‚Üí x:Name reference broken (XAML issue)
- If DataContext = **False** ‚Üí ViewModel not connected (binding issue)
- If both = **True** ‚Üí Good, structure is intact

---

### **Step 2: Click the Todo Icon (‚úì) or Press Ctrl+B**

You should see TWO MessageBoxes:

**First popup:**
```
IsRightPanelVisible changed to: True
About to call AnimateRightPanel
```

**What this tells us:**
- If you SEE this ‚Üí ViewModel is working, PropertyChanged fired ‚úÖ
- If you DON'T see this ‚Üí ViewModel isn't firing (logic issue)

**Second popup:**
```
Right panel width set to: 300px
Current: 300
```

**What this tells us:**
- If you SEE this ‚Üí AnimateRightPanel was called, width was set ‚úÖ
- If you DON'T see this ‚Üí Function not being called

## Possible Outcomes

### **Outcome A: You see "RightPanelColumn exists: False"**
**Diagnosis:** x:Name reference is broken  
**Fix:** XAML structure issue, need to fix NewMainWindow.xaml

### **Outcome B: You see "DataContext: False"**
**Diagnosis:** ViewModel not connected  
**Fix:** Binding issue in App.xaml.cs or window initialization

### **Outcome C: You don't see "IsRightPanelVisible changed" popup**
**Diagnosis:** PropertyChanged event not firing or not subscribed  
**Fix:** Event subscription or ViewModel issue

### **Outcome D: You see all popups but panel still doesn't appear**
**Diagnosis:** Width is being set but panel is invisible/hidden  
**Fix:** Visual issue (Z-order, visibility, rendering)

### **Outcome E: You see "Right panel width set to: 300px" but nothing visible**
**Diagnosis:** Panel exists but something is hiding it  
**Fix:** Investigate visual properties (opacity, visibility, Z-index)

## Report Back

After running the app and clicking the Todo icon, tell me:

1. **What MessageBoxes did you see?** (and what they said)
2. **In what order?**
3. **Did the panel appear?**

With this information, I'll know exactly what the issue is and how to fix it.

**Run the app now and report what you see!**
