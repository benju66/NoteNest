## 🎉 **EXCELLENT NEWS - TodoIdJsonConverter Works!**

### **From Latest Test (00:27:51):**

```
✅ [TodoSync] Processing note: Test 1.rtf
✅ [TodoSync] Found 1 todo candidates
✅ [CreateTodoHandler] Creating todo: 'test'
✅ [CreateTodoHandler] ✅ Todo persisted to event store
✅ [CreateTodoHandler] ✅ Applied inherited tags to todo
✅ [TodoSync] Created todo from note: "test" [uncategorized]
```

**No deserialization errors!** 🎉  
**TodoIdJsonConverter is working perfectly!** ✅

## 🔧 **Final Issue Fixed: Stale Projection Data**

### **The Last Problem:**
```
[WRN] Projection sync failed: UNIQUE constraint failed: todo_view.id
```

**Cause:** Old todo_view entries from previous tests  
**Fix:** Cleared projections.db (just now)  
**Result:** Will be recreated fresh on next start

---

## 📊 **CURRENT DATABASE STATE**

```
C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\

✅ events.db      - 135 KB (has all events, including your test todos)
✅ tree.db        - 376 KB (has all notes/categories)
❌ projections.db - DELETED (will be recreated fresh)
❌ todos.db       - Not created yet (will be created on startup)
```

**Perfect state for clean restart!** ✅

---

## 🚀 **WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON NEXT STARTUP**

```
1. App Starts
   ↓
2. EventStoreInitializer - events.db already exists ✅
   ↓
3. ProjectionsInitializer - Creates projections.db with fresh schema ✅
   ↓
4. Event store has data (position ~110+) - skip FileSystemMigrator ✅
   ↓
5. Projections catch up from position 0
   ├─ Process CategoryCreated events
   ├─ Process NoteCreated events  
   ├─ Process TodoCreatedEvent (with TodoIdJsonConverter!) ✅
   └─ Build tree_view, todo_view fresh ✅
   ↓
6. Note tree loads ✅
7. Existing todos appear in panel! ✅
8. App Ready! ✅
```

---

## 🧪 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Test 1: Verify Existing Todos Appear**

After restart:
- [ ] Check TodoPlugin panel
- [ ] **Expected:** Your test todos from previous runs should appear
- [ ] **Expected:** No UNIQUE constraint errors in logs

### **Test 2: Create NEW Note-Linked Todo**

1. Create or open a note
2. Type: `"Project planning [call John about budget review]"`
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. Wait 1-2 seconds
5. **Expected:** Todo "call John about budget review" appears in panel
6. **Expected:** Auto-categorized under note's parent folder

### **Test 3: Verify Complete Flow**

- [ ] Todo has inherited tags (folder + note tags)
- [ ] Edit bracket → todo updates
- [ ] Delete bracket → todo marked orphaned
- [ ] Complete todo → works
- [ ] Delete todo → works

## 📋 **EXPECTED LOGS (SUCCESS)**

```
[INF] ✅ Databases initialized successfully
[INF] 📊 Event store has data (position 110) - skipping file system migration
[INF] Starting projection catch-up...
[INF] Projection TodoView catching up from 0 to 110
