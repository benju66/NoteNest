# ‚úÖ DELETE KEY SUPPORT IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** Complete and ready to test  
**Date:** October 10, 2025

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS ADDED

Added **Delete key** functionality to remove categories from the Todo Tree.

### Implementation Details

1. **XAML Changes** (`TodoPanelView.xaml`)
   - Added `x:Name="CategoryTreeView"` to TreeView
   - Added `KeyDown="CategoryTreeView_KeyDown"` event handler

2. **Code-Behind** (`TodoPanelView.xaml.cs`)
   - Added `CategoryTreeView_KeyDown` method
   - Logic:
     - Detects **Delete key** press
     - Checks if selected item is a `CategoryNodeViewModel` (not a todo item)
     - Calls `CategoryStore.Delete(categoryId)` to remove the category
     - Logs the removal action
     - **Does NOT delete todos** (only uses checkbox/context menu for that)

3. **ViewModel Exposure** (`CategoryTreeViewModel.cs`)
   - Added public property: `public ICategoryStore CategoryStore => _categoryStore;`
   - Allows UI to access `CategoryStore` for delete operations

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Test 1: Delete Category with Delete Key
1. **Click** on "Projects" category in todo tree to select it
2. **Press Delete key**
3. **Expected:** "Projects" category disappears from todo tree
4. **Check logs:** Should see `[TodoPanelView] Category removed from todo tree: Projects`

### Test 2: Delete Key on Todo Item (Should Be Ignored)
1. If you have any todos under a category, **click on a todo item**
2. **Press Delete key**
3. **Expected:** Nothing happens (todos are completed via checkbox, not deleted)
4. **Check logs:** `[TodoPanelView] Delete key pressed on todo - ignoring (use checkbox to complete)`

### Test 3: RTF Auto-Categorization
1. **Create a fresh note:** "AutoTest.rtf" in "Projects" folder
2. **Add "Projects" to todo tree** (via context menu, if not already there)
3. **Type in note:** `[test task from rtf]`
4. **Save (Ctrl+S)**
5. **Wait 2-3 seconds**
6. **Check todo tree:** Should see the task appear under "Projects" category

## üîç WHAT TO VERIFY

### Delete Key
- ‚úÖ Category can be removed with Delete key
- ‚úÖ Selection is required (must click category first)
- ‚úÖ Only categories are deletable (not todo items)
- ‚úÖ Database persistence (category stays gone after app restart)

### RTF Extraction (From Previous Fix)
- ‚úÖ `[todo]` items are extracted from notes
- ‚úÖ Todos appear under correct category (based on note's folder)
- ‚úÖ New files are handled gracefully (even if not in DB yet)
- ‚úÖ Path normalization works (lowercase, canonical paths)

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL NOTES

### Why Only Categories?
- **Design decision:** Todo items should be **completed** (checkbox), not **deleted**
- Keeps todo history and prevents accidental data loss
- Delete key is reserved for structural changes (categories)

### Database Impact
- `CategoryStore.Delete()` automatically triggers `SaveToDatabaseAsync()`
- Change persists across app restarts
- Orphaned todos (if any) will need "Orphaned" category (future feature)

### Event Flow
1. User presses Delete key
2. `CategoryTreeView_KeyDown` fires
3. Checks selected item type
4. Calls `CategoryStore.Delete(categoryId)`
5. `CategoryStore` removes from `_categories` collection
6. `CategoryStore` calls `_persistenceService.SaveCategoriesAsync()`
7. Database updated
8. UI auto-refreshes (ObservableCollection)

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS (After Testing)

### If Delete Works:
1. Test RTF extraction (create note with `[todo]` items)
2. Verify auto-categorization
3. Plan "Orphaned" category for todos without categories

### If Issues Found:
1. Check logs for errors
2. Verify `CategoryStore` is accessible from ViewModel
3. Ensure database schema includes `user_preferences` table

## üéØ CURRENT TESTING PRIORITY

**PRIMARY:** Test Delete key (easy quick win)  
**SECONDARY:** Test RTF auto-categorization (more complex integration)

Both features should work independently, so we can verify them one at a time.
