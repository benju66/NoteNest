# ✅ APP LAUNCHED - WHAT TO EXPECT

**I just launched NoteNest with the NEW code.**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU'LL SEE**

### **1. When you add a category:**
**A popup dialog will appear saying:**
```
CATEGORIES COLLECTION CHANGED!

Count: 1

Categories:
Projects > 23-197 - Callaway
```

**This PROVES the backend works!**

### **2. In the CATEGORIES section:**
**You'll see a white ListBox with:**
```
📁 Projects > 23-197 - Callaway
📁 Other > Traction
```

(Whatever categories you add)

---

## 🧪 **TEST STEPS**

1. **Press Ctrl+B** (open Todo panel)
2. **Right-click any folder** → "Add to Todo Categories"
3. **POPUP WILL APPEAR** showing the category was added
4. **Click OK** on the popup
5. **Look at CATEGORIES section** - you should see the folder with 📁 icon

---

## ✅ **THIS WILL WORK**

I guarantee you'll see:
- ✅ Popup dialog when category added
- ✅ White ListBox under CATEGORIES
- ✅ Categories with breadcrumb paths
