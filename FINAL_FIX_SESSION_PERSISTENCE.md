# üéØ Session Persistence Issues - Analysis

**Current Issues:**
1. ‚ùå Todos don't persist between sessions
2. ‚ùå TodoView projection always starts from position 0
3. ‚ùå TodoStore loads before projections catch up

---

## üìä **Root Causes**

### **Issue 1: TodoView Position Not Persisting**

**Evidence:**
```
[Every startup] Projection TodoView catching up from 0 to 208
```

**This means:**
- GetLastProcessedPositionAsync() returns 0
- Position isn't being saved to projection_metadata
- OR it's being reset/cleared

**I've added logging to see:**
- Is SetLastProcessedPositionAsync() being called?
- Is projection_metadata entry being created?
- What position is being loaded on startup?

### **Issue 2: Race Condition on Startup**

**Sequence:**
```
16:16:59 - TodoStore loads (0 todos) ‚Üê TOO EARLY!
16:17:01 - Projections catch up (208 events) ‚Üê TOO LATE!
```

**TodoStore loads from todo_view BEFORE projections finish updating it!**

## ‚úÖ **Test With New Diagnostic Logging**

1. **Close app completely**

2. **Clear log:**
   ```powershell
   Clear-Content "C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\Logs\notenest-20251020.log"
   ```

3. **Launch app**

4. **Check logs for:**
   ```powershell
   $log = Get-Content "C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\Logs\notenest-20251020.log"
   $log | Select-String -Pattern "TodoView.*GetLastProcessedPosition|TodoView.*Saving position|TodoView.*Position saved"
   ```

This will show:
- ‚úÖ If SetLastProcessedPositionAsync is being called
- ‚úÖ If GetLastProcessedPositionAsync finds existing checkpoint
- ‚úÖ What position values are being saved/loaded

**Once you run this test, send me those log lines and I'll know exactly how to fix it!**
