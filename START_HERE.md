## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **✅ Issue #1: UI Visibility Bug**
**Problem:** New todos disappeared from view  
**Fix:** Updated "Today" filter to include null due dates  
**Result:** Todos now appear immediately ✅

### **✅ Issue #2: No RTF Integration**
**Problem:** Todos and notes were separate  
**Fix:** Implemented bracket parser + sync service  
**Result:** Notes and todos now connected! ✨

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to do anything special to activate bracket todos?**  
A: No! Just save a note with `[brackets]` and they appear automatically.

**Q: What happens to manual todos?**  
A: They work exactly as before - type in panel, they're saved.

**Q: What if I delete a bracket from a note?**  
A: Todo is marked "orphaned" (⚠️ red icon) but not deleted. You can keep or delete it.

**Q: Can I have brackets in multiple notes?**  
A: Yes! Each note is tracked separately.

**Q: Does this slow down note saving?**  
A: No! Sync happens in background after 500ms delay. UI stays responsive.

**Q: What if sync fails?**  
A: App continues working. Check logs for errors. Sync will retry on next save.
