# 🔍 DIAGNOSTIC - Parent Folder Path Issue

**Finding:** Parent folders are ALSO not in tree.db!

**Log Evidence:**
```
Line 40974: Note not in tree DB yet: Test Note 1.rtf - trying parent folder
Line 40975: Parent folder also not in tree DB yet
```

**This means:**
- ✅ My parent folder lookup code IS running
- ❌ But the folders aren't found in tree.db
- ❌ Path format mismatch OR folders not scanned

---

## 🎯 NEED TO INVESTIGATE

**Questions:**
1. What exact path is being looked up?
2. What paths ARE in tree.db for categories?
3. Format mismatch (absolute vs relative, casing, etc.)?

**Added diagnostic logging to see:**
```
[TodoSync] Looking up parent folder in tree.db: {exact path}
```

**This will tell us what we're searching for.**

**Next step after rebuild:**
1. Test again
2. Check logs for the exact path
3. Compare with what's actually in tree.db
4. Fix the path format mismatch

**The real-time updates ARE working! Just need to fix the path lookup.**
