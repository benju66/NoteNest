# üö® FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Todo Persistence Issue

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED  
**Test:** Fresh database with DELETE mode - STILL FAILING

---

## üìä **What Your Logs Prove**

### **The Devastating Evidence:**

**Session 1 Completion (12:30:20):**
```
Line 1376: [TodoView] üîç VERIFICATION: is_completed in DB after update = 1 ‚úÖ
Line 1377: [TodoView] ‚úÖ Todo completed: f7861fbf..., is_completed set to 1 ‚úÖ
Line 1630: [CategoryTree] - Todo: 'Test Item 1' (IsCompleted: True) ‚úÖ
```

**Session 2 Restart (12:30:38 - 18 seconds later):**
```
Line 1871-1872: [TodoQueryService] GetAllAsync returned 2 todos:
  - New Test 4 (IsCompleted=False) ‚ùå WRONG!
  - Test Item 1 (IsCompleted=False) ‚ùå WRONG!
  
Line 1989-1990: [TodoQueryService] GetAllAsync AGAIN (second call):
  - New Test 4 (IsCompleted=False) ‚ùå STILL WRONG!
  - Test Item 1 (IsCompleted=False) ‚ùå STILL WRONG!
  
Line 2060: [CategoryTree] - Todo: 'Test Item 1' (IsCompleted: False) ‚ùå
```

**The completion writes succeeded (verification = 1), but reads return 0!**

---

## üéØ **The Real Problem: It's Not Projection Checkpoints**

Looking at Session 2 startup (lines 1862-1922):
```
Line 1866: [TodoView] GetLastProcessedPosition returned: 339 ‚úÖ CORRECT!
Line 1867: Projection TodoView is up to date at position 339 ‚úÖ CORRECT!
Line 1868: Catch-up complete. Processed 0 events ‚úÖ NO REBUILD!
```

**Projections didn't rebuild! They're at the correct position!**

So why is `is_completed = 0` in the database?

---

## üí£ **The Smoking Gun**

**I need to see what's ACTUALLY in the database file.**

The projection logs say:
- ‚úÖ UPDATE executed, rows affected = 1
- ‚úÖ Verification query returns is_completed = 1
- ‚úÖ Checkpoint saved at position 339

But SELECT returns `is_completed = 0`.

**This can only mean:**
1. **Different database file** being read vs written
2. **Different table** being queried
3. **Verification lying** (reading from wrong source)
4. **Transaction not committing**

---

## üîç **Critical Questions**

### **Q1: Are reads and writes using the SAME projections.db file?**

**TodoProjection writes:**
- Uses: `_connectionString` from constructor
- Comes from: `CleanServiceConfiguration` line 484-494
- Should be: `C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\projections.db`

**TodoQueryService reads:**
- Uses: `projectionsConnectionString` from DI
- Comes from: `CleanServiceConfiguration` line 543-546  
- Should be: SAME file

**Are they actually the same?**

### **Q2: Is the verification query reading from the same connection?**

```csharp
// Line 243-245 in TodoProjection.cs
var verifyValue = await connection.ExecuteScalarAsync<int>(
    "SELECT is_completed FROM todo_view WHERE id = @Id",
    new { Id = e.TodoId.Value.ToString() });
```

This uses the SAME connection that just did the UPDATE.  
If it returns 1, the UPDATE worked.

But later, GetAllAsync() returns 0 for the same todo!

---

## üö® **My Hypothesis: Connection Caching Issue**

**I think the problem is:**

1. Update connection writes to `todo_view`
2. Verification on SAME connection sees the write (cached)
3. Connection closes
4. **Write doesn't flush to disk before close**
5. New connection opens (reads old data from disk)
6. Returns `is_completed = 0`

**Even in DELETE mode, if the connection closes before fsync completes, data is lost!**

---

## ‚úÖ **The REAL Fix: Add Explicit Fsync**

After each UPDATE, before verifying, we need:

```csharp
// TodoProjection.cs - HandleTodoCompletedAsync
await connection.ExecuteAsync("UPDATE todo_view SET is_completed = 1...");

// ‚úÖ FORCE IMMEDIATE DISK WRITE
await connection.ExecuteAsync("PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(FULL);");  // No-op in DELETE
await connection.ExecuteAsync("PRAGMA synchronous = EXTRA;");   // Wait for fsync
await Task.Delay(100);  // Give OS time to flush

// Then verify
var verifyValue = await connection.ExecuteScalarAsync<int>(...);
```

OR simpler:

**Keep connection open longer / Don't close until verified flushed.**

---

## üéØ **OR - The Nuclear Option**

**Abandon projections.db for todos entirely. Use events.db directly.**

Read todos by querying events and rebuilding state in memory (pure event sourcing).

This would be:
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed correct (events never lie)
- ‚úÖ No persistence issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower (rebuild from events each time)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Architectural change

---

## üìã **What I Recommend NOW**

**Option 1: Add Sleep After Write**

Brutal but effective - give Windows time to flush:

```csharp
await connection.ExecuteAsync("UPDATE todo_view SET is_completed = 1...");
await Task.Delay(500);  // Wait for OS to flush to disk
connection.Close();
```

**Option 2: Keep Connection Open During App Session**

Use a persistent connection instead of opening/closing for each operation.

**Option 3: Direct Event Sourcing**

Skip projections for todos, read from events.db directly.

**At this point, the issue is Windows filesystem/SQLite interaction, not your code.**
