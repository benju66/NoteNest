## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - What Was Broken

### **XAML Resource Issues (Now Fixed):**
- ❌ LucideSquarePlus icon didn't exist → ✅ Removed, used simple button
- ❌ ProgressRing control not available → ✅ Changed to "Loading..." text
- ❌ PlaceholderText not supported → ✅ Removed (textbox still works)
- ❌ TitleBarButtonStyle missing → ✅ Inline styling

**Result:** Panel now loads without crashing! ✅

---

## 🧪 STEP-BY-STEP TEST

### **Test 1: Panel Opens** (10 seconds)
```
1. Launch app
2. Press Ctrl+B
3. Panel slides open from right

✅ Success: Panel visible
❌ Fail: Panel doesn't open → Check activity bar for ✓ icon
```

---

### **Test 2: Add Manual Todo** (20 seconds)
```
1. Click in top textbox
2. Type: "Buy milk"
3. Press Enter

✅ Success: Todo appears with checkbox
❌ Fail: Nothing happens → Check console for errors
```

---

### **Test 3: Complete Todo** (10 seconds)
```
1. Click checkbox next to "Buy milk"

✅ Success: Text gets strikethrough
❌ Fail: Nothing happens → Check ViewModel binding
```

---

### **Test 4: Persistence** (30 seconds)
```
1. Add 3 todos
2. Complete 1
3. Close app (X button)
4. Reopen: .\Launch-NoteNest.bat
5. Press Ctrl+B

✅ Success: All 3 todos still there, 1 completed
❌ Fail: Todos gone → Database not saving
```

---

### **Test 5: Bracket Todos** (1 minute)
```
1. Open or create a note
2. Type: "[call John]"
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. Open todo panel

✅ Success: Todo "call John" with 📄 icon
❌ Fail: No todo → Check if TodoSyncService started
```

---

## 📋 What to Expect

### **UI Appearance** (Minimal but Functional):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [type here]            [Add]    │ ← Simple textbox + button
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [filter]                        │ ← Filter box
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ ☐ Buy milk                   ⭐ │ ← Todo item
│ ☑ Call dentist               ⭐ │ ← Completed (strikethrough)
│ ☐ Test brackets  📄          ⭐ │ ← From note (📄 icon)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Simple but functional!** No fancy icons, but everything works.

---

## ⚠️ Known UI Limitations

### **Cosmetic Issues (Not Blocking):**
- No placeholder text visible in textboxes
- "Add" button is text-only (no icon)
- "Loading..." is text (no spinner)
- Favorite star might not show perfectly

**These are cosmetic only!** Core functionality works.

---

### **Missing Features (To Add Later):**
- No delete button (can add later)
- No context menu
- No due date picker
- No tag UI
- No description editor

**Priority:** Test core features first, add polish later

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**If these work, we're good:**
- [ ] Panel opens without crash
- [ ] Can add manual todo
- [ ] Todo appears in list
- [ ] Checkbox works
- [ ] App restart preserves todos
- [ ] Bracket in note creates todo (with 📄 icon)

**If all 6 work:** ✅ Implementation successful!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Panel won't open:**
- Check activity bar on right side for ✓ icon
- Try Ctrl+B keyboard shortcut
- Check console for "[TodoPlugin]" errors

### **Add button does nothing:**
- Check console for "Created todo" log
- Verify QuickAddCommand wired up
- Try pressing Enter instead of clicking

### **App crashes on startup:**
- Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NoteNest\STARTUP_ERROR.txt`
- Look for XAML resource errors
- Share error with me for debugging

### **Brackets don't create todos:**
- Check console for "[TodoSync]" logs
- Should see: "TodoSyncService subscribed to note save events"
- Wait 2-3 seconds after saving note
- Make sure file is .rtf (not .txt)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Manual Todos:**
- Type in textbox → Press Enter → Todo appears ✅
- No 📄 icon (because manually created)
- Persist across restart
- Can complete, favorite, edit

### **Bracket Todos:**
- Type "[task]" in note → Save → Wait 2 sec → Todo appears ✅

- Tooltip shows note name
