# Tab Tear-Out Fix Summary

## The Root Cause

The issue was a **race condition** in the drag-and-drop tear-out functionality. When dragging a tab out of the main window:

1. `HandleNewDetachedWindowDropSync` was called
2. It used `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke` to queue the window creation for later execution
3. The method returned immediately, allowing `CleanupDrag()` to run
4. `CleanupDrag()` set `_draggedTab = null`
5. When the queued work finally executed, `_draggedTab` was null, so no tab appeared in the new window

## The Fix

The solution was to **capture the tab reference immediately** before queueing the async work:

```csharp
// CRITICAL: Capture the tab reference NOW before it gets cleared by CleanupDrag!
var tabToDetach = _draggedTab;
var sourcePaneVm = _paneView.DataContext as PaneViewModel;

// Now queue the async work with the captured reference
System.Windows.Application.Current.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(
    new Action(async () => 
    {
        // Use tabToDetach (captured) instead of _draggedTab (which may be null)
        sourcePaneVm?.RemoveTabWithoutDispose(tabToDetach);
        var initialTabs = new List<TabViewModel> { tabToDetach };
        var newWindow = await _windowManager.CreateDetachedWindowAsync(initialTabs);
        // ...
    }));
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **TabDragHandler.cs** - Modified `HandleNewDetachedWindowDropSync` to capture tab reference before async execution
2. **WorkspaceViewModel.cs** - Fixed context menu detach to use `RemoveTabWithoutDispose` instead of `RemoveTab`
3. **WindowManager.cs** - Added debug logging to track tab addition
4. **PaneViewModel.cs** - Existing `RemoveTabWithoutDispose` method prevents tab disposal during moves

## Why Context Menu Worked

The context menu detach worked because it was a simple async method without the timing issues introduced by `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke`.

## Result

- ✅ Dragging a tab out of the main window now creates a detached window WITH the tab visible
- ✅ No more empty "No tabs in this pane" windows
- ✅ All other drag functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ Consistent behavior between context menu and drag tear-out
