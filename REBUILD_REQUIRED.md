# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Rebuild Required!

**Issue:** You're running the OLD code, not the fixed version!

---

## üö® **WHY THE FIX DIDN'T WORK**

The build output showed:
```
error MSB3027: Could not copy apphost.exe - The file is locked by: "NoteNest.UI (25396)"
```

**This means:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiled successfully
- ‚ùå **But couldn't copy to bin folder** (app was running)
- ‚ùå **You're still running the old buggy version!**

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION - Rebuild Correctly**

```powershell
# 1. Close the app COMPLETELY
# Check Task Manager - kill any NoteNest.UI.exe processes

# 2. Clean
dotnet clean

# 3. Build (should succeed this time)
dotnet build

# Should see: "Build succeeded with X warning(s)" (NO errors)

# 4. Run the NEW version
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
```

## üß™ **Then Test:**

1. Add category: "Test Notes"
2. Create todo: [rebuild test task]
3. Verify in "Test Notes" category
4. Close app
5. Reopen app
6. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Task STILL in "Test Notes" category

---

**The fix IS in the code, but you need to rebuild with the app closed!**
