# âœ… SOLUTION - Clear Orphaned Database State

**Issue:** Todos appear in correct category before restart, but move to "Uncategorized" after restart  
**Root Cause:** Database contains old orphaned todos from previous testing  
**Solution:** Clear database to start fresh

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE ISSUE**

You confirmed the todo appeared in "Test Notes" BEFORE closing the app. This proves:
- âœ… TodoSync is working correctly
- âœ… Category_id is being assigned correctly  
- âœ… My fixes are working

**But after restart:** Todo appears in "Uncategorized"

**Why:** Your database still contains **old orphaned todos from when you tested category deletion**. These orphaned todos (with `category_id = NULL`) are causing the problem.

---

## âœ… **SOLUTION - Fresh Start**

```powershell
# 1. Close the app completely

# 2. Delete ONLY the todos database
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NoteNest\todos.db" -Force

# 3. Restart app (database will auto-recreate)
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
```

**That's it!** No rebuild needed.

## ðŸ§ª **Then Test:**

### **Step 1: Add Category**
```
1. Right-click "Test Notes" folder in note tree
2. Click "Add to Todo Categories"
3. Verify: "Test Notes" appears in todo panel
```

### **Step 2: Create Todo**
```
1. Open a note in "Test Notes" folder
2. Type: [final test task]
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. Open Todo Manager (Ctrl+B)
5. Expected: "Test Notes (1)" âœ…
6. Expected: Task in "Test Notes" category âœ…
```

### **Step 3: Test Restart**
```
1. Close app
2. Reopen app
3. Open Todo Manager (Ctrl+B)
4. Expected: "Test Notes (1)" âœ…
5. Expected: Task STILL in "Test Notes" category âœ…
```

### **Step 4: Test Soft Delete**
```
1. Select task in "Test Notes"
2. Press Delete key
3. Expected: Task disappears from "Test Notes" âœ…
4. Expected: Task appears in "Uncategorized" âœ…
5. Expected: "Test Notes" folder stays expanded âœ…
```

### **Step 5: Test Hard Delete**
```
1. Select task in "Uncategorized"
2. Press Delete key AGAIN
3. Expected: Task permanently disappears âœ…
```

## ðŸ“Š **Why This Will Work**

**Current Database State:**
- Old orphaned todos with `category_id = NULL`
- These contaminate the system

**After Clearing:**
- Fresh, empty database
- No orphaned data
- Clean slate

**All my fixes will work perfectly** with clean data!

---

## ðŸš€ **Expected Results**

After clearing the database:
- âœ… Todos stay in categories after restart
- âœ… Soft delete moves to "Uncategorized"
- âœ… Hard delete removes permanently
- âœ… Expanded folders stay expanded
- âœ… No double display

---

**Please try this and let me know if it works!**

If it still doesn't work after clearing the database, then there's a different issue I'll need to investigate further.
