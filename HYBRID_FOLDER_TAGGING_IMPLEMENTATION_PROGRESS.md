# 🏗️ HYBRID FOLDER TAGGING - IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Foundation Layer Complete ✅  
**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED: FOUNDATION LAYER**

### 1. Database Layer
- ✅ Created `Migration_003_CreateFolderTags.sql` for `folder_tags` table in tree.db
- ✅ Updated `TreeDatabaseInitializer` to load and apply migrations from embedded resources
- ✅ Added migration files as `EmbeddedResource` in `NoteNest.Infrastructure.csproj`
- ✅ Schema includes: `folder_id`, `tag`, `is_auto_suggested`, `inherit_to_children`, `created_at`, `created_by`
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### 2. Domain/Application Layer
- ✅ Created `FolderTag` model in `NoteNest.Application/FolderTags/Models/`
- ✅ Created `IFolderTagRepository` interface in `NoteNest.Application/FolderTags/Repositories/`
- ✅ Created `SetFolderTagCommand` and handler with validation
- ✅ Created `RemoveFolderTagCommand` and handler with validation
- ✅ Created `FolderTaggedEvent` and `FolderUntaggedEvent` domain events
- ✅ Proper layering: Application layer defines interfaces, Infrastructure implements

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- ✅ Implemented `FolderTagRepository` with all CRUD operations
- ✅ Recursive CTE queries for tag inheritance up the tree
- ✅ Transaction support, logging, error handling
- ✅ Follows existing `TreeDatabaseRepository` patterns
- ✅ Registered in `DatabaseServiceConfiguration`

### 4. Services Layer (UI Plugin)
- ✅ Created `ITagInheritanceService` and implementation
  - Handles tag inheritance from folders to todos
  - `UpdateTodoTagsAsync` for create/move operations
  - `BulkUpdateFolderTodosAsync` for retroactive application
  - `RemoveInheritedTagsAsync` for cleanup
- ✅ Created `IFolderTagSuggestionService` and implementation
  - Pattern detection for "25-117 - OP III" style folders
  - Generates 2 tags: "25-117-OP-III" and "25-117"
  - Tracks dismissed suggestions in memory
- ✅ Registered both services in `PluginSystemConfiguration`

### 5. Integration with Existing Code
- ✅ Updated `CreateTodoHandler` to apply folder tags on todo creation
- ✅ Updated `MoveTodoCategoryHandler` to update tags when todo is moved
- ✅ Removed old path-based auto-tagging logic (replaced with folder-based system)

### 6. Architecture & Best Practices
- ✅ Clean Architecture: Repository interfaces in Application layer, implementations in Infrastructure
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ CQRS pattern with MediatR
- ✅ Domain events for decoupling
- ✅ Dependency Injection throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Idempotent migrations

## 🔄 **REMAINING: UI LAYER** (Not Yet Started)

### Phase 1: Tree View Context Menu
- [ ] Add "Set Folder Tags..." menu item to category context menu
- [ ] Add "Remove Folder Tags" menu item
- [ ] Wire up to CQRS commands via MediatR

### Phase 2: Folder Tag Dialog
- [ ] Create `FolderTagDialog.xaml` WPF dialog
- [ ] Tag list display (auto-suggested vs manual)
- [ ] Add/remove tag UI
- [ ] "Apply to existing items" checkbox
- [ ] "Inherit to subfolders" checkbox
- [ ] Validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Tag Suggestion Popup (Optional)
- [ ] Create non-modal suggestion popup
- [ ] Show when user creates/navigates to project-pattern folder
- [ ] "Tag folder as '25-117-OP-III'?" with [Yes] [Customize] [No] [Don't Ask]
- [ ] Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
- [ ] Persist dismissed suggestions

### Phase 4: Visual Indicators
- [ ] Add tag icon to tagged folders in tree view
- [ ] Show tag count or tooltip on hover
- [ ] Style differentiation for auto-suggested vs manual tags

### Phase 5: Event Handlers
- [ ] Subscribe to `FolderTaggedEvent` in UI layer
- [ ] Bulk update todos when `ApplyToExistingItems = true`
- [ ] Subscribe to `FolderUntaggedEvent`
- [ ] Remove tags from todos when `RemoveFromExistingItems = true`

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Foundation Layer:** 100% Complete ✅  
**UI Layer:** 0% Complete ⏳  
**Overall Progress:** ~60% Complete

**Estimated Remaining Time:** 4-6 hours

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Context Menu Integration** (1 hour)
   - Add menu items to tree view
   - Wire up command execution

2. **Folder Tag Dialog** (2-3 hours)
   - Design XAML
   - Implement ViewModel
   - Connect to CQRS commands

3. **Event Handlers for Bulk Updates** (1 hour)
   - Subscribe to domain events
   - Implement bulk todo tagging logic

4. **Tag Suggestion Popup** (1-2 hours, optional)
   - Non-modal popup design
   - Auto-detection and display logic

5. **Testing & Refinement** (1 hour)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Bug fixes
   - UX polish

## 🎯 **KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

1. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Proper layering with no circular dependencies
2. ✅ **CQRS Pattern** - Commands, handlers, validators, and events
3. ✅ **Repository Pattern** - Interface in Application, implementation in Infrastructure
4. ✅ **Database Migrations** - Idempotent, version-tracked, embedded resources
5. ✅ **Tag Inheritance** - Smart service that handles folder hierarchy
6. ✅ **Pattern Detection** - Auto-suggest for project-style folders
7. ✅ **Event-Driven** - Decoupled UI updates via domain events

## 🔍 **TESTING PLAN** (To Be Executed After UI Completion)

### Database Tests
- [ ] Verify `folder_tags` table created correctly
- [ ] Test tag CRUD operations
- [ ] Test recursive inheritance queries
- [ ] Verify CASCADE DELETE works

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create todo in tagged folder → should inherit tags
- [ ] Move todo between folders → tags should update
- [ ] Set tags on folder with existing todos → bulk update works
- [ ] Remove tags from folder → todos updated correctly

### UI Tests
- [ ] Context menu appears for categories
- [ ] Folder Tag Dialog opens and saves correctly
- [ ] Tag suggestion appears for project-pattern folders
- [ ] Visual indicators show correctly

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Deeply nested folders (10+ levels)
- [ ] Moving between tagged and untagged folders
- [ ] Conflicting manual and auto-suggested tags
- [ ] Very long tag names
- [ ] Special characters in tags
- [ ] Empty folder names

## 📝 **NOTES**

- **Path-Based Auto-Tagging Removed:** The old system that generated tags from `category.DisplayPath` has been removed and replaced with the user-controlled folder tagging system.
  
- **Legacy Code:** The old `TagGeneratorService` is still present but only used for pattern detection in suggestions, not for automatic tagging.

- **Migration Safety:** All migrations use `INSERT OR REPLACE` for idempotence and include comprehensive comments.

- **Event Flow:** SetFolderTagCommand → FolderTaggedEvent → (Future) UI Event Handler → Bulk Update Todos

## 🎨 **DESIGN DECISIONS**

1. **Why Application Layer for Interface?**
   - Follows clean architecture principles
   - Infrastructure depends on Application, not vice versa
   - Avoids circular dependencies

2. **Why Separate TagInheritanceService?**
   - Keeps CQRS handlers clean and focused
   - Encapsulates complex inheritance logic
   - Testable in isolation

3. **Why Domain Events?**
   - Decouples command execution from UI updates
   - Allows multiple listeners (future extensibility)
   - Follows existing application patterns

4. **Why Hybrid Approach?**
   - User control over tags (addresses fragility of path-based)
   - Smart suggestions for convenience
   - Works across any file structure
   - Path-independent (machine-agnostic)
