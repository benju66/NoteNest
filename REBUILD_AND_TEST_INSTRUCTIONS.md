# üö® CRITICAL: Must Use NEW Build!

**Issue Detected:** The logs show the OLD version is running!

---

## ‚ùå EVIDENCE YOU'RE RUNNING OLD BUILD:

Looking at your log file, I see:
- Application started at 14:00:34
- Projections caught up
- TodoStore loaded todos
- **‚ùå MISSING:** All diagnostic logging I just added!

**Expected in new build:**
```
[TodoStore] ‚ö° CONSTRUCTOR called - About to subscribe to events
[TodoStore] Subscribing to NoteNest.Domain.Common.IDomainEvent...
[TodoStore] ‚úÖ CONSTRUCTOR complete - Subscriptions registered
```

**Not present in your logs!**

---

## ‚úÖ HOW TO USE NEW BUILD:

### **Step 1: Ensure Application is Closed**
```powershell
# Close NoteNest completely
# Or kill process:
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*NoteNest*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### **Step 2: Rebuild Solution**
```powershell
cd C:\NoteNest
dotnet build NoteNest.sln --force
```

### **Step 3: Run NEW Build**
- Navigate to: `C:\NoteNest\NoteNest.UI\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows`
- Run: `NoteNest.UI.exe`
- OR run from Visual Studio/Rider with F5

### **Step 4: Look for Diagnostic Logging on Startup**

**Immediately after startup, logs should show:**
```
[TodoStore] ‚ö° CONSTRUCTOR called - About to subscribe to events
[TodoStore] Subscribing to NoteNest.Domain.Common.IDomainEvent...
[TodoStore] ‚úÖ CONSTRUCTOR complete - Subscriptions registered
```

**If you DON'T see these messages, the new build isn't running!**

### **Step 5: Create Test Todo**
- Open a note
- Type: `[diagnostic test]`
- Press Ctrl+S

### **Step 6: Check for New Diagnostic Logs**

**You MUST see these new log messages:**
```
[CreateTodoHandler] Published event: TodoCreatedEvent
[InMemoryEventBus] ‚ö° Publishing event - Compile-time type: IDomainEvent, Runtime type: TodoCreatedEvent
[InMemoryEventBus] Created DomainEventNotification, about to call _mediator.Publish...
[InMemoryEventBus] _mediator.Publish completed successfully
```

**And ideally:**
```
[DomainEventBridge] ‚ö° RECEIVED notification - Event type: TodoCreatedEvent
[Core.EventBus] ‚ö° PublishAsync called - Compile-time type: IDomainEvent
[TodoStore] üì¨ ‚ö° RECEIVED domain event: TodoCreatedEvent
```

---

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS:

**The diagnostic logging will show us EXACTLY where the event chain breaks.**

Without it, we're flying blind.

With it, we can pinpoint:
- Does InMemoryEventBus receive the event?
- Does MediatR dispatch to DomainEventBridge?
- Does DomainEventBridge forward to Core.EventBus?
- Does Core.EventBus find handlers?
- Does TodoStore receive the event?

---

**PLEASE:**
1. Close app completely
2. Rebuild solution: `dotnet build NoteNest.sln --force`
3. Run NEW build
4. Verify you see diagnostic logging on startup
5. Create test todo
6. Check logs for diagnostic messages

**The diagnostic logs are the key to solving this!**
