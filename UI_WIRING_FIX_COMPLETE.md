## 🎯 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Critical Issue: Wrong Template**
- **Problem:** Created template at line 57 that wasn't being used
- **TreeView used:** Simple template at line 299
- **Fix:** Deleted unused template, updated TreeView's template with all features ✅

### **Icon Names**
- **Problem:** Used `LucideEdit` and `LucideTrash` (don't exist)
- **Fix:** Changed to `LucidePencil` and `LucideTrash2` ✅

### **Context Menu Bindings**
- **Problem:** Complex binding path that might not work
- **Fix:** Simplified to direct command bindings, moved menu to TreeView.Resources ✅

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Problem:** Binding to SelectedTodo (null reference)
- **Fix:** Merged into existing CategoryTreeView_KeyDown handler with null checks ✅

### **DeleteCommand**
- **Problem:** Context menu called DeleteCommand that didn't exist
- **Fix:** Added DeleteCommand to TodoItemViewModel ✅

## 📊 **CODE QUALITY**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Template not applied (features invisible)
- ❌ Wrong icon names (crashes)
- ❌ Complex bindings (might not work)
- ❌ Duplicate event handlers (compilation error)
- **Confidence:** 15%

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Correct template in TreeView.Resources
- ✅ Correct icon names (LucidePencil, LucideTrash2, LucideFlag)
- ✅ Simple direct bindings
- ✅ Merged event handlers
- ✅ All commands wired correctly
- **Confidence:** 95%

---

## 🎯 **ARCHITECTURE CORRECTNESS**

### **Matches NoteNest Patterns:**
- ✅ Implicit DataTemplate (by DataType) in TreeView.Resources
- ✅ Lucide icons with correct naming
- ✅ DynamicResource for theme-aware colors
- ✅ Code-behind for UI events (KeyDown, MouseClick)
- ✅ Commands for business logic
- ✅ Null-safe event handling

### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Context menu in TreeView.Resources (correct scope)
- ✅ Event handler checks null before executing
- ✅ `e.Handled = true` prevents bubbling
- ✅ Theme semantic brushes (AppErrorBrush, AppWarningBrush)
- ✅ Proper event handler merging (not duplicating)
