**Status:** ✅ Fix applied and app running  
**Test Time:** 3 minutes  
**Expected:** Todos auto-extracted from notes

---

## 🚀 **QUICK TEST (2 MINUTES)**

### **Setup:**
```
1. App is already running
2. Press Ctrl+B (open Todo Manager if not already open)
```

### **Test:**
```
1. Right-click "Projects" folder in note tree
2. Click "Add to Todo Categories"
3. Verify "📁 Projects" appears in Todo Manager

4. Create new note in "Projects" folder (or open existing one)
5. Type this EXACT text:
   [test task from RTF parser]
   
6. Save (Ctrl+S)
7. Wait 2 seconds
8. Look at Todo Manager
```

### **✅ SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:**
```
TODO MANAGER
├─ 📁 Projects
   └─ ☐ test task from RTF parser
```

### **❌ FAILURE LOOKS LIKE:**
```
TODO MANAGER
├─ 📁 Projects
   (empty - no todos)
```

---

## 📋 **IF IT WORKS**

**You'll see:**
- ✅ Todo appears under Projects category
- ✅ Todo text matches what you typed (without brackets)
- ✅ Todo is clickable/checkable

**Next Steps:**
1. Try Test 2 (auto-add category)
2. Try with multiple todos
3. Move to Phase 2 (orphaned category, backlinks, etc.)

---

## 📋 **IF IT DOESN'T WORK**

**Check logs:**
```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\Logs\notenest-20251009.log" | Select-Object -Last 50 | Select-String -Pattern "TodoSync"
```

**Look for:**
- `[TodoSync] Processing note: {your note name}`
- `[TodoSync] Found X todo candidates`
- Any errors or warnings

**Then share:**
1. Screenshot of Todo Manager
2. Log output
3. What you typed in the note

---

## 💡 **TIPS**

- Make sure you save the note (Ctrl+S)
- Wait 2 seconds (debounce delay)
- Refresh Todo Manager if needed (close/reopen with Ctrl+B)
- Check that "Projects" category exists in todo tree first

**Test now and let me know the results!**
