# Diagnostic: File Existence Issue

## üîç **Question to Answer**

Does the file `Test Note 12.rtf` actually exist on disk?

**Error shows path**: 
```
C:\Users\Burness\MyNotes\Notes\Projects\25-111 - Test Project\Test Note 12.rtf
```

---

## üìä **Possible Scenarios**

### **Scenario A: File Never Created** üî¥
**Cause**: CreateNoteHandler.WriteNoteAsync() failed silently

**Check**:
1. Browse to: `C:\Users\Burness\MyNotes\Notes\Projects\25-111 - Test Project\`
2. Look for: `Test Note 12.rtf`
3. **If NOT there**: File creation failed

**Why it might fail**:
- Directory doesn't exist
- Permission issues
- WriteNoteAsync threw exception (caught by MediatR)

---

### **Scenario B: File in Different Location** üî¥
**Cause**: Path mismatch - file created somewhere else

**Check**:
- Search for `Test Note 12.rtf` in entire MyNotes folder
- Compare found path vs expected path
- **If found elsewhere**: Path calculation mismatch

---

### **Scenario C: Path Separator Issue** üü°
**Cause**: Forward slash vs backslash (less likely on Windows)

**Theory**: Projection stores `"C:\...\Category/Note"` but file is at `"C:\...\Category\Note"`

**Unlikely because**: Windows normalizes separators automatically

---

### **Scenario D: Timing Issue** üü°
**Cause**: File write hasn't completed yet

**Check**: Wait a few seconds, try move again

---

## üéØ **DIAGNOSTIC STEPS**

### **Step 1: Verify File Exists**
```
Navigate to: C:\Users\Burness\MyNotes\Notes\Projects\25-111 - Test Project\
Look for: Test Note 12.rtf
Does it exist? YES or NO
```

### **Step 2: Check Error Happens Immediately or After Delay**
- Create note
- Wait 5 seconds (let file write complete)
- Try to move it
- Does error still occur?

### **Step 3: Check Actual vs Expected Path**
- What path does projection show?
- What path does file system show (if file exists)?
- Do they match exactly?

---

## üîç **LIKELY CAUSES (Ranked)**

### **1. File Write Failed** (60% likely)
CreateNoteHandler calls WriteNoteAsync but:
- Exception was caught by MediatR pipeline
- Event saved to EventStore ‚úÖ
- Projection updated ‚úÖ
- But file never written ‚ùå
- UI shows note (from projection) but file doesn't exist

**How to verify**: Check if Test Note 12.rtf exists on disk

---

### **2. Category Path in Projection is Wrong** (30% likely)
Migration populated category with one path, but actual folder is elsewhere

**How to verify**: Compare category.Path from projection vs actual folder location

---

### **3. Path Separator Normalization Issue** (10% likely)
DisplayPath has mixed separators that confuse file existence check

**How to verify**: Print both paths side-by-side (byte-by-byte comparison)

---

## ‚úÖ **NEXT STEPS**

**Please check**:
1. Does the file `Test Note 12.rtf` actually exist in that folder?
2. If NO: File creation is failing (need to fix WriteNoteAsync error handling)
3. If YES but different path: Path calculation mismatch
4. If YES at that exact path: File existence check is wrong

**This will tell us the exact fix needed.**
