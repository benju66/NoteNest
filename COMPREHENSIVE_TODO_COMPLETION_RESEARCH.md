# üìä Comprehensive Research - Todo Completion & UI

**Purpose:** Understand the complete system before implementing  
**Approach:** Research, don't implement  
**Focus Areas:** 4 identified issues + additional considerations

---

## üîç AREA 1: Checkbox UI Updates (Strikethrough/Faint)

### **What Should Happen:**
- ‚úÖ Click checkbox ‚Üí Todo marked complete
- ‚úÖ UI updates: Strikethrough + faint text
- ‚úÖ Click again ‚Üí Unchecked, normal styling

### **Current Behavior (Per User):**
- ‚úÖ Checkbox executes command (logs confirm)
- ‚ùå UI doesn't visually update (no strikethrough/faint)

### **Investigation Needed:**

**Q1: What triggers the visual update?**
- Check: Is there a style/trigger based on IsCompleted property?
- Check: XAML binding to IsCompleted
- Check: Style for completed items

**Q2: Is IsCompleted property notifying?**
- Check: TodoItemViewModel.IsCompleted setter
- Check: INotifyPropertyChanged implementation
- Check: Property change propagation

**Q3: Event flow working?**
- Logs show: CompleteTodoEvent published ‚úÖ
- Logs show: TodoStore receives event ‚úÖ
- Check: Does TodoStore update the in-memory collection?
- Check: Does TodoItemViewModel get updated?

---

## üîç AREA 2: Completed Items Behavior

### **Current Behavior (To Research):**
- Unknown: Do completed items disappear?
- Unknown: Are they filtered out somewhere?
- Unknown: Is there a "show completed" toggle?

### **Desired Behavior (Per User):**
- ‚úÖ Completed items stay in list (don't disappear)
- ‚úÖ Move to bottom of list (below uncompleted)
- ‚úÖ Can be toggled visible/hidden via toolbar

### **Investigation Needed:**

**Q1: Current filtering logic?**
- Check: TodoStore.GetByCategory() - does it filter completed?
- Check: TodoListViewModel - any completed filters?
- Check: Smart list implementations

**Q2: Sorting logic?**
- Check: How are todos ordered in the list?
- Check: Is there sort-by-completion logic?
- Check: How to make completed go to bottom?

**Q3: Existing visibility toggles?**
- Check: Are there any "show completed" flags?
- Check: Settings or view state?

---

## üîç AREA 3: Toolbar with List-Checks Icon

### **Requirements:**
- Add toolbar/command bar at top of todo treeview
- Icon: list-checks (Lucid icon)
- Function: Toggle completed items visibility
- SVG code provided

### **Investigation Needed:**

**Q1: Where do Lucid icons live?**
- Check: Resource dictionary location
- Check: How other icons are defined
- Check: Naming convention

**Q2: Toolbar architecture?**
- Check: Does TodoPanelView have a toolbar section?
- Check: How is it structured in XAML?
- Check: Where should toggle state be stored?

**Q3: Toggle implementation pattern?**
- Check: How do other view toggles work?
- Check: Is there a ViewState or Settings object?
- Check: How to persist user preference?

## üîç AREA 4: Additional Considerations

### **Items to Research:**

**Data Layer:**
1. Completed items in projections.db
2. Querying for both completed and uncompleted
3. Performance with large todo lists

**UI Layer:**
1. Binding refresh when completion changes
2. Visual state management
3. Collection sorting/filtering

**Event Sourcing:**
1. TodoCompletedEvent handling
2. Projection updates for completion
3. Query service for completed items

**User Experience:**
1. Keyboard shortcuts (space to toggle?)
2. Bulk operations (complete all, etc.)
3. Undo/redo support

**Architecture:**
1. Command pattern consistency
2. MVVM compliance
3. Separation of concerns

## üìã RESEARCH PLAN

### **Phase 1: Understand Current State** (30 min)

1. **Checkbox Binding** (10 min)
   - Read: TodoPanelView.xaml checkbox definition
   - Read: TodoItemViewModel.IsCompleted property
   - Read: Any styles/triggers for completed items
   - Check: INotifyPropertyChanged implementation

2. **Completed Item Handling** (10 min)
   - Read: TodoStore filtering logic
   - Read: GetByCategory implementation
   - Read: Smart list definitions
   - Check: Any existing "include completed" flags

3. **Toolbar Infrastructure** (10 min)
   - Find: Lucid icon resource dictionaries
   - Read: TodoPanelView.xaml structure
   - Check: Other toolbar implementations in app
   - Review: Command bar patterns

### **Phase 2: Identify Gaps** (20 min)

1. **Missing Functionality**
   - What exists vs what's needed
   - Dependencies between features
   - Potential conflicts

2. **Architecture Review**
   - Does solution fit existing patterns?
   - CQRS compliance
   - Event sourcing compatibility

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Completed items in subfolders
   - Filtering + sorting interactions
   - State persistence

### **Phase 3: Design Solution** (20 min)

1. **Detailed Implementation Plan**
   - Step-by-step approach
   - Dependencies and order
   - Rollback points

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could go wrong
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Testing approach

3. **User Experience Flow**
   - Click checkbox ‚Üí Visual feedback
   - Toggle completed ‚Üí Filter/show
   - Restart app ‚Üí State preserved

## üéØ DELIVERABLES

After research, I will provide:

1. **Current State Analysis**
   - What exists
   - What's missing
   - Why checkbox doesn't show visual feedback

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Each feature broken down
   - Dependencies identified
   - Order of implementation

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could break
   - How to test each piece
   - Rollback strategy

4. **Time Estimates**
   - Per feature
   - Total effort
   - Complexity assessment

**Starting research now - will provide comprehensive analysis before any implementation.**
