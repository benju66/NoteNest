## Issue Resolution

### **TabShadow Error - RESOLVED** ✅

**Error Message:**
```
MC4111: Cannot find the Trigger target 'TabShadow'
```

**Root Cause:**
- WPF doesn't allow targeting elements inside `Border.Effect` from triggers
- DropShadowEffect can't be named and targeted

**Solution:**
- Removed all `TargetName="TabShadow"` setter references
- Removed `x:Name="TabShadow"` from DropShadowEffect
- Kept the shadow effect itself (same shadow on all tabs)

**Impact:**
- Tab shadow is still present (professional appearance maintained)
- Active tabs don't get enhanced shadow (minor limitation)
- All other modernizations preserved

---

## ✅ All UI Updates Successfully Implemented

1. ✅ **Typography System** - 6 text styles in App.xaml
2. ✅ **Spacing System** - Spacing and corner radius constants  
3. ✅ **Enhanced Focus Indicators** - Better keyboard navigation
4. ✅ **Fixed Hardcoded Colors** - Dialogs now theme-aware
5. ✅ **Tab Modernization** - 6px corners, 2px gaps, smooth transitions
6. ✅ **GroupBox Replacement** - Modern headers with Lucide icons

---

## 🚀 Ready to Run

```bash
dotnet run --project NoteNest.UI
```

### **What to Look For:**

1. **Modern panel headers:**
   - "📁 NOTES" with folder icon
   - "📄 WORKSPACE" with file icon

2. **No heavy borders:**
   - Clean, modern panels instead of GroupBox

3. **Better tabs:**
   - 6px rounded corners (more visible)
   - 2px gaps between tabs
   - Smooth hover transition (150ms fade)

4. **Theme-aware dialogs:**
   - Create/rename dialogs respect theme
   - Test in all 4 themes
