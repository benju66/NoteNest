> "A comprehensive task management plugin that seamlessly integrates with NoteNest's RTF-based note system, providing unified task tracking with bidirectional synchronization between notes and todos."

### **Current Implementation:**

**Unified Task Tracking:** ✅ Working
- Todos in panel + brackets in notes

**Bidirectional Synchronization:** ✅ 60% Complete
- Note → Todo: ✅ Complete (automatic extraction)
- Todo → Note: ⏳ Phase 3 (visual indicators planned)

**Seamless Integration:** ✅ Working
- Event-driven (no manual triggers)
- Automatic reconciliation
- Icon indicators show links
- Tooltips provide context

**RTF-Based:** ✅ Working
- Leverages SmartRtfExtractor
- Works with any RTF file
- Non-destructive (safe)

**Progress: ~50%** of guide's full vision  
**Core Features: 100%** implemented

---

## 🎯 What's Still From Guide

### **Deferred (Smart Decisions):**
- TODO: keyword (wait for user feedback)
- Toolbar button (low value, high complexity)
- RTF file modification (high risk, questionable value)
- Rich domain model (DTOs work fine)
- Recurrence (future)
- Advanced hierarchy UI (basic exists)

### **To Add Based on Usage:**
- Visual indicators in RTF editor (if users want it)
- Fuzzy text matching (if exact matching insufficient)
- Additional patterns (if users request)
- Advanced UI features (tags, dates, descriptions)

**Philosophy:** Start simple, iterate based on real usage ✅
