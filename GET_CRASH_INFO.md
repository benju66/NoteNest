# ðŸš¨ Getting Crash Information

## The logs show you're still running the OLD build!

The log file you shared is from **16:41:00** and has NO diagnostic messages (no ðŸŽ¯ emoji logs) which I added to the code.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Definitive Test - Run This:**

### **Step 1: Force Clean Rebuild**
```powershell
.\Rebuild-And-Launch.bat
```

This will:
- Clean all old build artifacts
- Rebuild from scratch
- Launch the NEW version

### **Step 2: Press Ctrl+B**

### **Step 3: Check for Crash Info**

After it crashes, check these locations:

#### **A. Latest Log File:**
```
C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\Logs\
```
Look for the **NEWEST** file (sort by date modified). It should have a timestamp **after 16:41:00**.

#### **B. Startup Error File:**
```
C:\Users\Burness\AppData\Local\NoteNest\STARTUP_ERROR.txt
```
If this exists, share its contents.

#### **C. Windows Event Viewer** (if no logs):
1. Press Win+X â†’ Event Viewer
2. Windows Logs â†’ Application
3. Look for errors from "NoteNest.UI.exe" or ".NET Runtime"
4. Double-click the error to see details

## ðŸŽ¯ **Alternative: Console Launch**

Try this to see the exception in real-time:

```powershell
.\Launch-With-Console.bat
```

This keeps a console window open. When the app crashes, you'll see the exception message in the console window.

Press Ctrl+B and **immediately read the console window** - it will show the exact exception!

---

## ðŸ“¤ **What to Share:**

1. **Console output** from Launch-With-Console.bat (shows exception)
2. **Or** the NEWEST log file (with timestamp after 16:41)
3. **Or** screenshot of Windows Event Viewer error

Any of these will show us the exact crash point!

---

## ðŸ’¡ **My Theory:**

I suspect one of these:

1. **XAML parsing error** - TodoPanelView.xaml has a resource reference that doesn't exist
2. **DI injection failure** - TodoListViewModel or TodoPanelView can't be created
3. **Missing assembly** - Some DLL isn't being copied

The console launch will show this immediately!

**Please try: `.\Launch-With-Console.bat` â†’ Press Ctrl+B â†’ Share what appears in the console**
