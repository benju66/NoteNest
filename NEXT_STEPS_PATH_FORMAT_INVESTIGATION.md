# üîç Path Format Investigation Needed

**Status:** Parent folder lookup running but not finding folders  
**Evidence:** Logs show "Parent folder also not in tree DB yet"

---

## üéØ WHAT WE KNOW

**From Logs:**
```
[TodoSync] Note not in tree DB yet: Test Note 1.rtf - trying parent folder
[TodoSync] Parent folder also not in tree DB yet
```

**My code IS running** - it's looking up the parent folder.  
**But it's not finding it** - the folder isn't in tree.db (or path doesn't match).

---

## üîç DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING ADDED

**Next test will show:**
```
[TodoSync] Looking up parent folder in tree.db: {exact path}
```

**This will reveal:**
- What exact path we're searching for
- Whether it's the right format
- Can compare with actual tree.db contents

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

**After app finishes starting:**

1. **Create a todo in a note**
   - Open existing note (e.g., in "Projects" folder)
   - Type: `[path debug test]`
   - Press Ctrl+S

2. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   [TodoSync] Looking up parent folder in tree.db: {path}
   ```

3. **Share that exact path with me**

**Then I can:**
- Compare with tree.db format
- Identify the mismatch
- Fix the path conversion
- Get CategoryId working!

---

**The good news:** Real-time updates work! Just need to fix the path lookup.
