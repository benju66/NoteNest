# RTF Editor Fixes Implemented

## Overview
Four RTF editor improvements have been successfully implemented based on user feedback. All changes are low-risk and focused on improving user experience.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Save on Tab Switch
**File Modified:** `NoteNest.UI/ViewModels/Workspace/PaneViewModel.cs`
- **Change:** Added automatic save when switching tabs if the previous tab has unsaved changes
- **Implementation:** Modified the `SelectedTab` setter to check if the previous tab is dirty and trigger `SaveAsync()`
- **Impact:** Prevents data loss when users switch tabs without manually saving
- **Risk:** Minimal - uses existing save infrastructure

### 2. ✅ Toolbar Button Spacing
**File Modified:** `NoteNest.UI/Controls/Editor/RTF/RTFToolbar.xaml`
- **Changes:**
  - Reduced button `MinWidth` from 60 to 36 pixels
  - Reduced button `Padding` from "8,4" to "6,4"
- **Impact:** Toolbar buttons are now more compact, allowing all buttons to be visible in split view
- **Risk:** None - purely visual adjustment

### 3. ✅ Paste Formatting Removal
**File Modified:** `NoteNest.UI/Controls/Editor/RTF/RTFEditor.cs`
- **Changes:**
  - Added paste command override in `InitializeKeyboardShortcuts()`
  - Implemented `OnPasteCommand()` to strip external formatting
  - Added `CanPasteCommand()` for paste availability check
- **Implementation:** Intercepts paste operations and inserts clipboard content as plain text
- **Impact:** Pasted text now inherits the current editor formatting instead of bringing external styles
- **Risk:** Low - includes fallback to default paste on error

### 4. ✅ List Item Spacing
**File Modified:** `NoteNest.UI/Controls/Editor/RTF/RTFEditorCore.cs`, `RTFEditor.cs`
- **Changes:**
  - List margins: Changed from `(0,0,0,6)` to `(0,4,0,8)` for better separation
  - ListItem margins: Changed from `(0,0,0,0)` to `(0,2,0,2)` for item spacing
  - ListItem padding: Changed from `(0,0,0,2)` to `(0,0,0,0)`
- **Impact:** Improved visual hierarchy and readability of bulleted/numbered lists
- **Risk:** None - styling changes only

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Save on Tab Switch:**
   - Create/edit content in a tab
   - Switch to another tab without saving
   - Verify the content is saved and dirty indicator clears

2. **Toolbar Spacing:**
   - Open editor in split view
   - Verify all toolbar buttons are visible
   - Test in different window sizes

3. **Paste Formatting:**
   - Copy formatted text from external sources (Word, web pages)
   - Paste into the editor
   - Verify text appears with editor's current formatting

4. **List Spacing:**
   - Create multi-level bulleted lists
   - Check spacing between items at different indent levels
   - Verify readability improvements
