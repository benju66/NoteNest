# 🔧 Todo Plugin - What Was Broken & What's Fixed

**Your Feedback:** App froze, crashed, brackets did nothing, UI not ready  
**Root Cause:** XAML resource errors preventing panel from loading  
**Status Now:** ✅ **FIXED - Ready to Test**

---

## ❌ What Was Broken

### **1. XAML Compilation Failures**

**Error 1:** `LucideSquarePlus` icon doesn't exist  
**Error 2:** `ui:ControlHelper.PlaceholderText` not supported  
**Error 3:** `ui:ProgressRing` control not available  
**Error 4:** `TitleBarButtonStyle` doesn't exist

**Result:** XAML couldn't compile → TodoPanelView failed to load → App crashed when opening panel

---

### **2. UI Logic Bug**

**Problem:** Today view excluded todos with null due dates  
**Result:** New todos immediately disappeared after adding

---

## ✅ What's Fixed

### **All XAML Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ Removed LucideSquarePlus → Simple "Add" button
- ✅ Removed PlaceholderText → Plain textbox
- ✅ Removed ProgressRing → "Loading..." text
- ✅ Removed TitleBarButtonStyle → Inline styling

### **UI Logic Fixed:**
- ✅ Today view now includes null due dates
- ✅ Todos appear immediately after adding

### **Error Handling Added:**
- ✅ Database init won't crash app
- ✅ Todo loading won't crash if DB fails
- ✅ ViewModel creation wrapped in try-catch

---

## 🧪 TEST NOW

```powershell
.\Launch-NoteNest.bat
# Press Ctrl+B
# Type "test" and press Enter
# Todo should appear! ✅
```

---

## 🎯 What You'll See

### **Todo Panel UI (Minimal MVP):**
- Textbox at top (for adding)
- "Add" button (text only, no icon)
- List of todos below
- Filter box
- Checkboxes and stars work

**Not pretty, but functional!**  
**We can add polish after confirming it works.**
