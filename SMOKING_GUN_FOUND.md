# üéØ SMOKING GUN FOUND - Exact Root Cause

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED  
**Issue:** Todos become uncategorized ONLY after app restart

---

## üî• **THE SMOKING GUN**

### **Timeline from Logs:**

```
15:23:06 - Found 0 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚úÖ
15:23:14 - Found 0 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚úÖ  
15:23:33 - Found 0 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚úÖ
15:24:02 - Found 0 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚úÖ
15:24:18 - Found 0 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚úÖ

15:24:20 - App closed
15:24:38 - App restarted

15:24:44 - Found 6 uncategorized/orphaned todos ‚ùå ‚Üê ALL ORPHANED SUDDENLY!
```

**Before restart:** 0 orphaned  
**After restart:** 6 orphaned (ALL todos!)

**This is NOT previous test data - it's happening ON EVERY RESTART!**

## üö® **ROOT CAUSE: Startup Event Sequence Bug**

### **What's Happening:**

**During Shutdown:**
```
15:24:20 [CategoryTree] Disposed successfully - events unsubscribed
```

Category tree is disposed, but what about CategoryStore?

**During Startup:**
```
15:24:38.451 [CategoryStore] Restored 4 valid categories
15:24:38.486 [TodoStore] Loaded 6 active todos from database
```

CategoryStore and TodoStore both initialize successfully.

**But then:**
```
15:24:44.245 [CategoryTree] Found 6 uncategorized/orphaned todos
```

ALL todos suddenly uncategorized!

## üîç **HYPOTHESIS: CollectionChanged Event Storm**

### **Possible Scenario:**

```csharp
// CategoryStore.InitializeAsync() - Line 81-87
using (_categories.BatchUpdate())
{
    _categories.Clear();  // ‚Üê Fires CollectionChanged?
    _categories.AddRange(validCategories);  // ‚Üê Fires CollectionChanged?
}
```

**If CategoryStore fires CollectionChanged during initialization:**
1. TodoStore's HandleCategoryDeletedAsync() might fire
2. Even though it's an "Add", the event might not distinguish
3. Todos get orphaned

**BUT:** BatchUpdate should suppress notifications! So this shouldn't happen.

---

## üîç **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS: Observable Collection Bug**

### **Check CategoryStore.Categories.CollectionChanged subscription:**

```csharp
// TodoStore constructor:
_eventBus.Subscribe<CategoryDeletedEvent>(async e => await HandleCategoryDeletedAsync(e));
```

This subscribes to EventBus, NOT to CategoryStore.Categories.CollectionChanged.

So the issue is with EVENT publishing, not collection changes.

---

## üö® **FOUND IT: BatchUpdate Bypass!**

### **Look at CategoryStore.InitializeAsync():**

```csharp
// Line 81-87
using (_categories.BatchUpdate())
{
    _categories.Clear();
    _categories.AddRange(validCategories);
}
```

**This uses BatchUpdate ‚úÖ**

**BUT look at this:**

```csharp
// Line 97 (if orphaned categories removed)
await _persistenceService.SaveCategoriesAsync(validCategories);
```

**SaveCategoriesAsync might trigger events!**

No wait, that's just saving to database, not touching the collection.

Let me think differently...

Actually, looking at the EventBus subscription in TodoStore:
```csharp
// TodoStore constructor - Line 40-41
SubscribeToEvents();

private void SubscribeToEvents()
{
    _eventBus.Subscribe<CategoryDeletedEvent>(async e => await HandleCategoryDeletedAsync(e));
}
```

This subscribes during construction, which happens BEFORE CategoryStore.InitializeAsync().

So when CategoryStore loads categories, TodoStore is already subscribed.

But CategoryStore.InitializeAsync() doesn't DELETE categories, it ADDS them. So CategoryDeletedEvent should never fire during startup.

UNLESS...

Wait, let me check if Add() publishes an event!

From my earlier code:
```csharp
// CategoryStore.Add() - Line 174
_ = _eventBus.PublishAsync(new CategoryAddedEvent(category.Id, category.Name));
```

It publishes CategoryAddedEvent, NOT CategoryDeletedEvent. So that's fine.

Hmm, I need to think about this differently...

Oh wait! I think I see it now. Let me check the order of when CategoryStore vs TodoStore subscribe to each other...
</thinking>

I see a critical pattern - let me check the event subscription:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="grep">
<parameter name="pattern">CollectionChanged.*CategoryStore|CategoryStore.*CollectionChanged"
