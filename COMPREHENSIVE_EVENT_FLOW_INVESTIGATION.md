# Comprehensive Event Flow Investigation

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Issue:** Todos don't appear in tree until app restart  
**Approach:** Methodical investigation with high confidence before fix  
**Status:** Investigation Plan Created

---

## üéØ **What We Know**

### **Facts:**
1. ‚úÖ Todos ARE being created (persist after restart)
2. ‚úÖ Database writes work (data is saved)
3. ‚úÖ "Most things work" (other operations functional)
4. ‚ùå Tree doesn't refresh immediately after creation
5. ‚úÖ Tree DOES refresh after app restart (reads from database)

### **Scope:**
- Affects quick-add (manual creation)
- Affects RTF extraction (note-linked tasks)
- Does NOT affect other operations (checkbox, etc. - need confirmation)

---

## üîç **Possible Root Causes (Systematic Analysis)**

### **Category A: Event Publishing Failure**

**Hypothesis:** Events aren't being published at all

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "Published event: TodoCreatedEvent"
- Check CreateTodoHandler line ~95: `await _eventBus.PublishAsync(domainEvent);`

**If True:**
- EventBus.PublishAsync not working
- Domain events not in aggregate
- ClearDomainEvents called too early

**Confidence: 15%** (Unlikely - EventBus works for CategoryDeletedEvent)

---

### **Category B: Event Subscription Failure**

**Hypothesis:** TodoStore isn't subscribed to TodoCreatedEvent

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "[TodoStore] Handling TodoCreatedEvent"
- Verify SubscribeToEvents() was called in constructor
- Check if Subscribe<TodoCreatedEvent> syntax is correct

**If True:**
- Subscription syntax wrong
- EventBus.Subscribe not working for new events
- Type mismatch (Domain.Events.TodoCreatedEvent vs something else)

**Confidence: 25%** (Possible - new event type, might have subscription issue)

---

### **Category C: Event Handler Execution Failure**

**Hypothesis:** Event is received but handler fails silently

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "[TodoStore] Handling TodoCreatedEvent"
- Check if exception thrown: "[TodoStore] Failed to handle TodoCreatedEvent"
- Check if Repository.GetByIdAsync returns null

**Possible Failures:**
- Repository.GetByIdAsync(e.TodoId.Value) returns null (timing issue?)
- Exception thrown in handler (caught and logged)
- Dispatcher.InvokeAsync fails silently

**Confidence: 30%** (Likely - handler execution issues common)

---

### **Category D: Collection Update Failure**

**Hypothesis:** Collection is updated but change not propagated

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "[TodoStore] ‚úÖ Added todo to UI collection"
- Check if SmartObservableCollection fires CollectionChanged
- Check if _todos.Add() actually adds item

**Possible Failures:**
- SmartObservableCollection in BatchUpdate mode (suppresses notifications)
- Add() fails silently
- Duplicate check prevents add (todo.Id already exists somehow)

**Confidence: 20%** (Possible - collection notification issue)

---

### **Category E: Tree Rebuild Failure**

**Hypothesis:** CollectionChanged fires but tree doesn't rebuild

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "[CategoryTree] üîÑ TodoStore.AllTodos CollectionChanged!"
- Check if OnTodoStoreChanged is called
- Check if LoadCategoriesAsync executes

**Possible Failures:**
- Subscription to AllTodos.CollectionChanged not working
- SmartObservableCollection doesn't expose CollectionChanged
- OnTodoStoreChanged is called but Dispatcher.InvokeAsync fails

**Confidence: 40%** (Most Likely - this is where I suspect the issue)

---

### **Category F: Tree Build Logic Issue**

**Hypothesis:** Tree rebuilds but new todo isn't included

**Evidence Needed:**
- Check logs for: "[CategoryTree] Loading X todos for category"
- Check if BuildCategoryNode is called for the right category
- Check if GetByCategory returns the new todo

**Possible Failures:**
- GetByCategory filters out the new todo (IsOrphaned=true? IsCompleted=true?)
- CategoryId mismatch (todo.CategoryId != expected category)
- GetByCategory returns NEW collection that doesn't share reference

**Confidence: 35%** (Likely - filtering or state issue)

---

## üìã **Investigation Steps**

### **Step 1: Check What "Most Things Work" Means**

**Questions for User:**
1. Does checkbox toggle work AND show immediately?
2. Does editing text work AND show immediately?
3. Does priority change work AND show immediately?
4. Does deletion work AND remove immediately?

**Why This Matters:**
- If other updates work ‚Üí Event system is fine, issue is specific to Create
- If no updates work ‚Üí Event system broken entirely
- If only Create fails ‚Üí Issue in HandleTodoCreatedAsync

---

### **Step 2: Request Log Output**

**Need user to:**
1. Launch app with current code (with enhanced logging I added)
2. Add a todo via quick add
3. Share complete log output from that operation

**What Logs Will Tell Us:**
- ‚úÖ Did CreateTodoCommand execute?
- ‚úÖ Did event get published?
- ‚úÖ Did TodoStore receive event?
- ‚úÖ Did collection get updated?
- ‚úÖ Did CollectionChanged fire?
- ‚úÖ Did tree refresh get triggered?

**This ONE test will eliminate 80% of possibilities!**

---

### **Step 3: Verify Event Subscription Syntax**

**Current Code:**
```csharp
_eventBus.Subscribe<Domain.Events.TodoCreatedEvent>(async e => await HandleTodoCreatedAsync(e));
```

**Verify:**
- Is this the correct EventBus.Subscribe signature?
- Does it work for CategoryDeletedEvent (existing)?
- Type name correct?

---

### **Step 4: Check Collection Exposure**

**Current Code:**
```csharp
public ObservableCollection<TodoItem> AllTodos => _todos;
```

**Verify:**
- Does SmartObservableCollection expose CollectionChanged event?
- Can external code subscribe to it?
- Is the property exposing the right collection?

---

### **Step 5: Analyze GetByCategory Filtering**

**Current Code:**
```csharp
public ObservableCollection<TodoItem> GetByCategory(Guid? categoryId)
{
    var filtered = new SmartObservableCollection<TodoItem>();
    var items = _todos.Where(t => t.CategoryId == categoryId && 
                                  !t.IsOrphaned &&
                                  !t.IsCompleted);
    filtered.AddRange(items);
    return filtered;
}
```

**Potential Issues:**
- Returns NEW collection each time (not shared reference)
- CategoryTreeViewModel might be holding old reference
- Filter excludes new todo (IsOrphaned? IsCompleted?)

---

## üéØ **Most Likely Root Cause (Initial Hypothesis)**

**Based on architecture analysis:**

**Hypothesis #1 (40% confidence):**
`GetByCategory` returns a NEW collection each time. CategoryTreeViewModel calls this once during BuildCategoryNode and holds that reference. When new todo is added to TodoStore._todos, the filtered collection in the tree doesn't update because it's a snapshot, not a live filter.

**Evidence:**
```csharp
// In BuildCategoryNode
var categoryTodos = _todoStore.GetByCategory(category.Id);
// This returns a NEW SmartObservableCollection
// Tree node holds this collection
// When _todos updates, this filtered collection doesn't automatically update
```

**Hypothesis #2 (35% confidence):**
Event subscription isn't working. EventBus.Subscribe syntax might be different than expected, or event type mismatch.

**Hypothesis #3 (25% confidence):**
Repository.GetByIdAsync in event handler returns null because of timing (transaction not committed yet?), so todo never gets added to collection.

## üìä **Investigation Priority**

### **Priority 1: GET LOG OUTPUT** üî¥ CRITICAL

**This is the MOST important step!**

Without logs, I'm guessing. With logs, I KNOW.

**User needs to:**
1. Run app with current code (enhanced logging added)
2. Add a todo
3. Share log output from CreateTodoCommand through tree refresh

**This will tell us:**
- Where the flow succeeds ‚úÖ
- Where the flow breaks ‚ùå
- Exact failure point

---

### **Priority 2: Understand Current Behavior**

**Questions:**
1. Do checkbox toggles show immediately? (tests event system for updates)
2. Does deletion show immediately? (tests event system for deletes)
3. What category is selected when you quick-add?
4. After restart, is the todo in the correct category?

---

### **Priority 3: Code Analysis**

**Only after log data:**
- Analyze specific failure point
- Check relevant code paths
- Build 90%+ confidence in root cause
- Design proper fix

---

## üö® **Why I Should NOT Fix Yet**

**Current Confidence in Root Cause: 40%**

**This is TOO LOW to implement a fix!**

**Risks of Premature Fix:**
- Fix wrong thing (waste time)
- Introduce new bugs
- Miss actual root cause
- Create technical debt

**Better Approach:**
1. Get data (logs) ‚Üí 80% confidence
2. Analyze data ‚Üí 90% confidence
3. Verify hypothesis ‚Üí 95% confidence
4. Implement targeted fix ‚Üí 98% success rate

---

## üìã **What I Need From You**

### **To Complete Investigation:**

**Option A: Share Logs (BEST)** ‚≠ê
- Run app
- Add a todo via quick add
- Copy log output (look for CreateTodoCommand, TodoCreatedEvent, TodoStore, CategoryTree messages)
- Paste here
- **Time: 5 minutes**
- **My Confidence After: 85-90%**

**Option B: Answer Questions**
- Do checkbox toggles show immediately?
- Does deletion show immediately?
- What happens with completion/priority/favorite?
- **Time: 2 minutes**
- **My Confidence After: 70-75%**

**Option C: Debug Together**
- Run app with logging
- Step through operations
- Real-time diagnosis
- **Time: 15-30 minutes**
- **My Confidence After: 95%+**

---

## üí° **Proper Process**

**What I Should Have Done:**

1. ‚úÖ Ask for logs/data FIRST
2. ‚úÖ Analyze actual behavior
3. ‚úÖ Build hypothesis with evidence
4. ‚úÖ Verify hypothesis (80%+ confidence)
5. ‚úÖ Design targeted fix
6. ‚úÖ Implement with high confidence
7. ‚úÖ Test and verify

**What I Actually Did:**

1. ‚ùå Assumed root cause
2. ‚ùå Implemented quick fix
3. ‚ùå Low confidence (60%)
4. ‚ùå Wasted your time

**I apologize for rushing. Let's do this right.** üôè

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**Please provide:**

**Minimum (2 min):**
- Do checkbox/delete/priority changes show immediately?
- What category is selected during quick-add?

**Ideal (5 min):**
- Log output from adding a todo
- From "ExecuteQuickAdd CALLED" through "Tree refresh complete"

**Then:**
- I'll analyze with 85-90% confidence
- I'll propose a targeted fix
- You'll approve before I implement
- Much higher success rate
