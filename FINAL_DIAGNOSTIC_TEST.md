# üî¨ Final Diagnostic Test - Type Handler Tracing

**Added:** Debug logging to NullableGuidTypeHandler to see if it's being called

---

## üìã **RUN THIS TEST:**

### **1. Close app completely**
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM NoteNest.UI.exe /T
```

### **2. Rebuild**
```powershell
cd C:\NoteNest
dotnet clean
dotnet build
```

### **3. Delete database**
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NoteNest\.plugins\NoteNest.TodoPlugin\*.*" -Force
```

### **4. Run app from Visual Studio (NOT Launch-NoteNest.bat)**
```
- Open NoteNest.sln in Visual Studio
- Press F5 (Debug mode)
- This will show Debug.WriteLine output!
```

### **5. Quick test**
- Add "Test Notes" category
- Create todo: [type handler test]
- Close app from VS

### **6. Check Debug Output window in Visual Studio**

**Look for:**
```
[GuidTypeHandler] Parse called: value='54256f7f...' ‚Üí parsed to XXX
```

**OR**
```
[GuidTypeHandler] Parse called: value=null/DBNull ‚Üí returning null
```

---

## üîç **This Will Tell Us:**

**If you see Parse called with the GUID string:**
- Type handler IS being called
- But it's failing to parse for some reason
- Will show exact failure point

**If you see Parse called with null:**
- Database value is actually NULL (shouldn't be based on exports)
- Or Dapper is passing NULL for some other reason

**If you see NO Parse calls:**
- Type handler isn't registered properly
- Or Dapper isn't using it

---

**Run from Visual Studio in Debug mode and watch the Output window!**

Alternatively, if you don't have VS:
```powershell
# Run with debugger attached
dotnet run --project NoteNest.UI
# Check console output for Debug.WriteLine messages
```

**This is the final diagnostic that will show exactly what's happening!**
