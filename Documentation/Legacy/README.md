# Legacy Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is **no longer applicable** to the current version of NoteNest.

## Files in this folder:

### `MARKDOWN_GUIDE_OBSOLETE.md`
- **Status**: Obsolete as of RTF-only architecture implementation
- **Reason**: NoteNest now uses **RTF format exclusively** for all notes
- **Migration**: All notes are automatically saved as RTF format
- **User Impact**: Users get consistent rich text editing without format conversion complexity

## Current Architecture (RTF-Only)

NoteNest has been simplified to use **Rich Text Format (RTF) exclusively** for:
- ✅ **Consistent formatting** across all notes
- ✅ **Rich text editing** with full formatting support  
- ✅ **Reliable compatibility** across devices and platforms
- ✅ **No format conversion** needed - everything is RTF
- ✅ **Simplified architecture** - no multi-format complexity

## For Developers

If you need to understand the old multi-format architecture, refer to the files in this Legacy folder. However, **all new development should assume RTF-only**.
